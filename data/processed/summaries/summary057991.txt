Police say they haven't eliminated Phillip Garrido as suspect in girls' disappearances.
Authorities seek evidence in abductions of Michaela Garecht, Ilene Misheloff.
Police began executing search warrants last week on Garrido property.
The Garridos are accused in 1991 kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard, then 11.
