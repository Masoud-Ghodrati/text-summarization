"You got to marry these girls when they are about 15 or 16," Phil Robertson says in old video.
The clip was originally posted in 2009, then posted again to YouTube on Monday.
This month, Robertson drew ire with controversial comments about homosexuality, race.
HLN has reached out to the "Duck Dynasty" family for comment but has not heard back.
