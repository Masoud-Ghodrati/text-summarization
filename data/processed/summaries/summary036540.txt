In the lead up to Iran's election, the state has made the internet nearly unusable for many of its citizens.
Usually Iranians use VPN software to bypass government controls, but lately, these too have been blocked.
Some fear the government is unleashing malware and phishing software to spy on Iranian citizens.
U.S. government announced it will allow export of services to allow Iranian people greater freedom on communication.
