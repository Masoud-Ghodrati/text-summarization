Matthew Whitaker: Articles said women could avoid rape if they didn't drink too much.
He says it's ridiculous to focus on women's behavior and not crime of the rapist.
He says women should not be expected to prevent their rape, made to feel guilt if they didn't.
Whitaker: This discussion is retrograde. To prevent rape, fix misogyny, not women's behavior.
