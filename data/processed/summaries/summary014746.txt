Too many people are dying in their attempts to reach safety in Europe, writes Maurice Wren.
This incident is an appalling reminder of what happens when people escaping persecution are denied access to safety, he says.
Wren: In the absence of safe, legal ways to reach European territories, refugees are forced into dangerous and abusive situations.
European governments must work in solidarity to ensure people fleeing human rights violations and persecution are given entry, he says.
