John Avlon: The view that it's too soon after Colorado to talk about gun control is wrong.
He says politicians are making a mistake by ducking action on the issue.
A new poll of NRA members shows support for reasonable restrictions on guns, he says.
Avlon: Nearly 10,000 are murdered by gunshots each year; that must be reduced.
