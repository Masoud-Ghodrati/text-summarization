Ricot Duprevil, 31, was in stable condition with fractured thigh bone after rescue, officials say.
Unclear if he was rescued from newly collapsed building or one that fell two weeks ago.
Duprevil was severely dehydrated when found, medics say.
If he survived being trapped for two weeks, he ties record set in 1990 Philippines quake.
