On April 14, Boko Haram militants abducted more than 200 girls from a school in Nigeria.
The schoolgirls had been sleeping at the school in Chibok, in northeastern Borno State.
Producer Lillian Leposo was part of a CNN team that spent four days traveling to the village.
They passed numerous checkpoints until the final 45 minute leg to Chibok itself.
