Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, soon will take over as speaker of the House.
Boehner was emotional the night the GOP swept to power in the U.S. House.
He recounted his humble beginnings and hard work "chasing the American dream".
He's still the same man he was when he came to Congress, a close friend says.
