Aaron Vargas was set to stand trial for first-degree murder next week in Darrell McNeill's death.
Vargas says McNeill molested him as a teen, emotionally tormented him as an adult.
Many in community support Vargas; other adult men say McNeill abused them as children.
Mendocino County District Attorney says there is no way to substantiate abuse claims.
