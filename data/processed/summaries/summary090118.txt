Costa Concordia salvage operation is all under control, officials say.
The ship will only be searched for the remains of the last victim when it reaches Genoa.
It is not expected to start its final journey, under tow, until next week.
Underwater cameras reveal no cracks or fissures after the vessel was refloated Monday.
