Benjamin Jealous: Rand Paul's attempt to heal rift between blacks and GOP fell short.
He says if GOP wants to draw black votes, it can start by committing to civil rights.
One way is criminal justice reform, Jealous says.
Jealous: Sentencing reform, education would bring down spending. GOP, get on board.
