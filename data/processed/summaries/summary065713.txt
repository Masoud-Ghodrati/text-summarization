Lindsey Vonn misses a gate and can't complete a downhill in Val d'Isere, France.
Vonn says she is still injured and will likely only take part in one or two races before the Olympics.
Marianne Kaufmann-Abderhalden won the race ahead of Tina Maze.
Canada's Erik Guay wins a men's downhill in Val Gardena, one of the classics.
