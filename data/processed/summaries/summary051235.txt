A tiny minority of Muslims preach hatred and violence, says Naif Al-Mutawa.
He says as the father of five he wanted to make sure they have the right role models.
Al-Mutawa created "The 99," a comic series of superheroes fighting for positive values.
Those who kill in the name of Islam are making an unspeakable insult to the religion, he says.
