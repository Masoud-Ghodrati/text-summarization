The Balkans are enduring the worst flooding in 120 years, since record keeping began.
26 bodies have been recovered, and rescuers expect to find more as waters recede.
The low pressure system drenching the peninsula is known as a "cutoff low".
Last week, the cutoff low lasted up to four days and dumped two months' worth of rain.
