The A&W in Cedar Rapids was Doug Ward's life for 30 years until last year's flood.
Almost a year later, the drive-in sits in ruins, the root beer mugs still muddied.
The drive-in has been a landmark in the Time Check neighborhood since 1948.
It will cost upward of $1 million to rebuild or change locations.
