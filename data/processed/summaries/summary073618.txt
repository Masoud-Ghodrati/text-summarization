Italian police recover two valuable paintings that were stolen more than 40 years ago.
The art was stolen in London and later abandoned on a Paris-to-Turin train.
A factory worker bought the paintings at a lost-property auction in 1975.
He paid about 22 euros for both, and one may be worth at least 10 million euros now, police say.
