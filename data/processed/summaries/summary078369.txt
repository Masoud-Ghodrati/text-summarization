"Sweet" Alice Harris of Watts, California, gives $5 to any kid who wants a saving account.
The kids must pledge to stay in school -- and seek to go to college.
Nearly 100 kids apply for the savings accounts Saturday.
40 youths who opened the savings accounts in the past three years are now going to junior college.
