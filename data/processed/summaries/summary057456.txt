Dutch artist Christien Meindertsma catalogued all the uses to which one pig was put.
She found it was used in everything from toothpaste to dough improver.
The pig's heart valves can save a life and its collagen can fill a wrinkle.
She says the project showed "we have no clue of what is in the products that surround us".
