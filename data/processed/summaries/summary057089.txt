Victor Carlos got the flu, then an acute bacterial infection, then an illness that attacked his lungs.
When he checked into the hospital, his blood oxygen level was at 57%.
Doctors started a procedure known as ECMO that gave Carlos' lungs time to heal.
Carlos took his first breath four weeks later and is now training for a marathon.
