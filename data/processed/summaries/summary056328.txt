AirAsia investigation unlikely to be as frustrating as MH370 case, analysts say.
For one, AirAsia disappeared over shallower, more heavily traveled waters.
AirAsia disappearance is lacking many of the mysterious hallmarks of MH370 case.
Experts expect plane will be found soon, maybe in next 12 hours of daylight.
