Woody Allen's latest movie, "Blue Jasmine," will not be screened in India.
India's laws require anti-smoking adverts to be shown when characters light up on screen.
"We have to abide by the law of the land," the film's Indian distributor says.
The movie, starring Cate Blanchett and Alec Baldwin, has won critical acclaim.
