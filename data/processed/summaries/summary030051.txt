Activists called for an end to fossil fuel subsidies at last month's Rio +20 Earth Summit.
Subsidies for the fossil fuel sector total $1 trillion annually, according to Oil Change International.
OCI says public money should not be going to industries that contribute to climate change.
Others believe cutting fossil fuel subsidies could hit the people in the developing world hardest.
