Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo says there will be no No. 1 driver at Ferrari.
Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen will be Ferrari's driver partnership in 2014.
Di Montezemolo awarded Alonso a "good eight out of 10" rating for the 2013 season.
This season comes to an end with the Brazilian Grand Prix this weekend.
