Les Enfants De Dieu is a care center that gives food and shelter to street kids in Kigali, Rwanda.
The center's 126 boys, aged 6 to 18, love to dance and are passionate about hip-hop.
UK hip-hop dancers traveled to Kigali last year to teach the children how to "break".
The project was captured in "Yes, Man," a film to be shown at London's Africa Utopia festival.
