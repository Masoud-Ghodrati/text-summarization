Author Ilie Ruby remembers the thrills of hearing ghost stories around campfires.
The one about Derek, the monster boy who lived in the woods, was a favorite.
Ghost stories "offer us a sense of control over terror, something unattainable in real life".
They make us feel better about our lives, and fear drives us closer to people, Ruby says.
