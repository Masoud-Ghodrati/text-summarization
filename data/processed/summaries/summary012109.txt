Bob Greene: Former classmate's fifth-grade teacher sent copy of 1958 Mother's Day card.
Students had given the card to Miss Twyford, beloved teacher who had no children.
Greene: Miss Twyford says she treasures card; only Mother's Day card she's received.
Greene: She's taught 700 kids; all would surely say: Happy Mother's Day, Miss Twyford.
