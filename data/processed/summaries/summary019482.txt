New York City rolled out a fleet of new iris scanners in a police initiative announced this week.
Police turned to scanners after recent escapes of inmates who used false identities.
Civil liberty groups say NYPD is "hitting a fly with a sledgehammer".
City officials say department is "authorized to take pictures," including photos of irises.
