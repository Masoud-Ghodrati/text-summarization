Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused of using explosives-filled pressure cookers as bombs.
He is charged with "using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction" (WMD).
Claims Saddam Hussein was stockpiling WMDs formed part of the argument for the Iraq War.
The term "WMD" is often used to refer to nuclear, biological and chemical arms.
