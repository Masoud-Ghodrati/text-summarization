Gov. Sarah Palin's family moved to Alaska in 1964, when she was 2 months old.
Palin rose from Wasilla City Council to Alaska's governorship in 14 years.
"She has always gone after what she wants with great intensity," family friend says.
Praise and criticism followed Palin's ascendance to the governor's office.
