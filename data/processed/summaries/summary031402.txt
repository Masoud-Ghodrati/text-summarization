Policeman is photographed holding what appears to be an Assange arrest plan.
A line can be read saying, "Assange to be arrested under all circumstances".
"The document is not related to the Julian Assange case," a police spokeswoman says.
Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June.
