Sally J. Clark says Seattle's minimum wage increase should be a model for other cities.
She points out that no other major city has committed to this kind of minimum wage increase.
We can't leave people who cook our food and clean our homes trapped in poverty, she says.
A higher wage, she argues, means more stable individuals, families, neighborhoods.
