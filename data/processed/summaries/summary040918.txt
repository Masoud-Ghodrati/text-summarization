Harold "Jim" Nicholson will be sentenced Tuesday, again, for espionage.
He admitted continuing his covert activities while imprisoned in Oregon.
He could have gotten 25 years, but through a plea deal, he'll receive eight more.
The former CIA station chief previously got 23 years for spying for Russia.
