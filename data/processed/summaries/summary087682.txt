Joel Sartore's work appears in 'Rare: Portraits of America's Endangered Species'.
The Nebraska native traveled the country to photograph 69 endangered animals and plants.
Sartore says many people are surprised that so many species are on the verge of extinction.
Sartore: "My job is to ... get people to see what's going on. It's not hopeless".
