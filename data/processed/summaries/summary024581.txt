Former ESPN employee Anthony Federico tells the New York Daily News, "I'm so sorry".
He wrote a headline that included the phrase "Chink in the Armor".
Basketball sensation Jeremy Lin did not think the slur was on purpose and does not care anymore.
Federico tells the paper he is proud of his career at ESPN.
