Qassim Shesho commands about 2,000 Yazidi fighters on Mount Sinjar in Iraq.
He and his sons, all Iraq natives and German citizens, came after ISIS attacked Yazidis.
"I decided to defend Sinjar, not to fight. They decided to fight," he says of ISIS.
Shesho's son Yassir: "If it comes to it, then I'm ready to die here".
