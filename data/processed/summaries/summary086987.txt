Matias Duarte, Google's Director of Android User Experience, says smartphones must work the way people expect.
"I want everything can you touch on the screen to operate like objects in the real world do," he says.
Duarte identifies gesturing and "tangibility" as big upcoming developments in mobile technology.
Says Android is "a gift" Google are giving to the world.
