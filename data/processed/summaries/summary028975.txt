Ban on Al-Muhajiroun, also known as Islam4UK, will take effect Thursday.
Islamist group proposed to march through town where war dead brought home.
Group is already banned under two other names in the Terrorism Act 2000 -- Al-Ghurabaa and The Saved Sect.
The group's leader Anjem Choudary said the ban would not stop them.
