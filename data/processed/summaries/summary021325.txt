A fire sparked by Superstorm Sandy destroyed 126 homes on Long Island.
It was ignited when storm surge water came into contact with a home's electrical system.
Residents say Long Island Power Authority and National Grid, should have cut power.
"The effort to place fault for this tragedy with the utility is misplaced," LIPA says.
