Doping allegations against Lance Armstrong bring out conflicting views over his legacy.
Many fans say Livestrong is "bigger than Armstrong" and will continue wearing the bracelet.
Others who say he was face of hope for cancer survivors are devastated by allegations.
"I can't wear it with pride," says woman whose father was cremated wearing bracelet.
