Saber Kashour pretended to be single and Jewish before having sex with an Israeli woman.
"Eighteen months in prison is too much" for consensual sex, the convicted man's lawyer says.
Kashour says he's known as "Dudu," a nickname for the Jewish name "David".
Kashour's claim that he was single "would be relevant" to case, legal center official says.
