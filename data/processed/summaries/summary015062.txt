Authorities say Jordan Brown, then 11, shot and kiled his father's pregnant girlfriend in 2009.
Initially charged as an adult, a Pennsylvania judge then ruled he'd be tried as a juvenile.
3 Pennsylvania newspapers argued Brown's proceedings should be open to the public.
A Superior Court opinion says they'll be closed to assure the accused boy's privacy.
