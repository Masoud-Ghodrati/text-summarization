Roland Martin: Gun lovers should be free to own shotguns, pistols and the like but not AK-47s.
Martin supports right to own gun but says Constitution doesn't say any gun you'd like.
He says National Rifle Association is wrong to oppose reasonable restrictions.
He says president is right about AK-47s -- they belong on battlefield, not city streets.
