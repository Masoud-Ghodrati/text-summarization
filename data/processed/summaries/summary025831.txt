Rafael Nadal returns to top spot in the world tennis rankings, overtaking Novak Djokovic.
Nadal last held the No. 1 ranking in June 2011, before he was caught by Djokovic.
Nadal's achievement comes after he missed seven months with a serious knee injury.
The Spaniard won two majors in 2013 to lift his tally to 13, four behind Roger Federer.
