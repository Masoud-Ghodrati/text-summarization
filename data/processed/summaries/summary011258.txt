NEW: Amnesty International: "Is anybody ever going to be brought to justice?".
Ramush Haradinaj was indicted on charges of abusing and killing detainees.
A trial court acquitted Haradinaj and two others in 2008.
Prosecutors appealed, and the appeals chamber reinstated six counts against the three men.
