Australian rugby league star Todd Carney has been sacked by his club over a lewd photo.
The picture appeared to show the player urinating into his own mouth.
Carney's agent says the picture was private and his client has been treated harshly.
Carney has previously been sacked for alcohol-related misbehavior.
