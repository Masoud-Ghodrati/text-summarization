NEW: The Republic of Congo's health minister calls the polio outbreak "worrying".
A massive polio immunization campaign is set for three west African nations.
The death toll is at 97, an unusually high rate given the 226 cases, officials say.
The immunization push, starting Friday, follows similar efforts in recent months.
