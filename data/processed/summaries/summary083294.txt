Paul McCartney signs an open letter urging Scotland to stick with the United Kingdom.
"We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship," the letter says.
Scotland is holding a referendum on independence on September 18.
Anyone over 16 living in Scotland has a vote, but residents of other UK countries do not.
