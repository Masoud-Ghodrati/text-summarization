Huge crowds march in Hong Kong calling for democracy on the anniversary of handover.
511 protesters arrested at illegal sit-in following the march, say police.
An annual event, the march is especially charged this year amid a heated political climate.
Pro-democracy activists are threatening to "occupy" downtown if calls are not heard.
