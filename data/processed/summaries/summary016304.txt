43 students from a teachers college went missing in Mexico more than a month ago.
Mexico's attorney general says new arrests bring investigators closer to cracking the case.
The case has sparked protests across the country and spurred a governor to step down.
Investigators say a grave site found at a landfill could be connected to the case.
