Riccardo Ricco is suspended by his Dutch-based Vacansoleil cycling team.
The team say they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend him.
Ricco was admitted to an Italian hospital last week with a high fever and kidney problems.
Italian media claimed the 27-year-old fell ill after injecting infected blood.
