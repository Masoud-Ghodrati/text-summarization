Pep Guardiola's mentor Juanma Lillo says his former player will be a success at Bayern.
Former Barcelona coach Guardiola called Lillo the best manager he ever played under.
Lillo says Guardiola will make Bayern's squad better players and better people.
Guardiola will join the German giants in July after a year's sabbatical from soccer.
