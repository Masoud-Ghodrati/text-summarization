Basel was a major town in the middle ages, a legacy of this is the pretty Old Town.
A highlight of a stroll round the city is a trip to the Munster and Kunstmuseum.
Outside of town is the 2,000 year-old Roman settlement of Augusta Raurica.
The Hasenhorn toboggan run 25 miles east of Basel is also worth a trip.
