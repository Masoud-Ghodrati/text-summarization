In 1978, 909 Americans were led to mass murder-suicide by Rev. Jim Jones.
One-third of the dead at Jonestown were children; only 33 people survived.
Jones was a self-appointed minister and phony faith healer from the Midwest.
Unlike his followers, Jones was shot in the head, probably by a trusted aide.
