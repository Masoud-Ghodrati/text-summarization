NEW: Stranded woman leaves handwritten notes detailing ordeal.
"Right now, we're just celebrating," Rita Chretien's son says of his mom's recovery.
She was stuck in a remote mountain area, largely living off candy and melted snow.
The search continues for her husband, who left March 22 seeking help.
