Scientists say hull found at the WTC site likely originated from a forest in the Philadelphia area.
Vessel likely built around 1773 and believed to have been a "Hudson River Sloop" ship.
Scientists analyzed and compared tree-rings on wood from the ship with wood samples to determine probable age.
Ship's hull was found by archeologists at ground zero site in July 2010.
