Vodafone India announced launch of M-Pesa, a mobile phone based banking service.
M-Pesa was first established in Kenya in 2007 as a way to transfer money and pay bills.
Vodafone says 700mn Indians are "unbanked", with no access to traditional bank services.
In 2011, India had 986mn mobile phone subscriptions, second largest after China.
