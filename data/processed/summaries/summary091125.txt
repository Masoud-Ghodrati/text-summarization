Pope Francis washed the feet of 12 people at a home for the elderly and disabled.
Ceremony is traditionally carried out on Holy Thursday, to remember Jesus' Last Supper.
Until last year, pontiff washed the feet of members of the clergy.
Pope Francis broke with tradition, to include "ordinary" people; women and non-Christians.
