A judge rules Jared Loughner can continue his medical treatment until June.
The judge says a psychologist found "measurable progress" in Loughner's mental state.
He is accused of killing 6 people and wounding 13 others, including Gabrielle Giffords.
The medical treatment is aimed at getting Loughner competent to stand trial.
