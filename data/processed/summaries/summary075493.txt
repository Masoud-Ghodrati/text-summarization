Steven Green was found in his cell on Thursday and died two days later.
A medical examiner ruled his death suicide by hanging.
In 2006, Green and four others raped a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and killed some of her family.
He was sentenced to multiple life terms in federal court because he had left the Army.
