NEW: A Libyan-backed ship carrying aid for Gaza unloads at the Egyptian port of Al Arish.
The ship's captain is awaiting final approval to unload aid.
The ship attempted to break an Israeli naval blockade of Gaza, but was diverted.
Israeli soldiers killed nine activists aboard another aid ship in May.
