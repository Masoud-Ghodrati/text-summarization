A grand jury is considering whether to bring charges against Officer Darren Wilson.
"It's very tough to convict an officer," a retired chief deputy U.S. marshal says.
The officer will have to "explain a reason for each of those six shots," a legal analyst says.
A federal civil rights investigation is also underway.
