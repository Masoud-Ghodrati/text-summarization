In a 310-303 vote, the church decides to pull $21 million in investments.
It is divesting from Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions.
Jewish groups, and some Presbyterians, condemn the decision.
The church is keeping other investments in Israel, while investing in Palestinian territories, too.
