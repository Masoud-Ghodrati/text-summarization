Rezwan Ferdaus, 26, a U.S. citizen, is charged in plot to bomb Pentagon and Capitol.
He was allegedly going to use a $6,500 remote-controlled plane laden with explosives.
He is accused of pledging jihad against the United States.
But authorities say he had no real ties to al Qaeda and wasn't a real threat.
