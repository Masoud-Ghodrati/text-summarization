Miller Francis: George Zimmerman trial should be renamed the Trayvon Martin trial.
He says question not raised: Wasn't Martin the one standing his ground, facing a stalker?.
We're told that by defending himself, Martin justified his own execution, he says.
Francis: Prosecution should use stand-your-ground on Martin's behalf; it's about race, justice.
