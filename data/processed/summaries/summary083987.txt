Rudy Ruiz writes that "peace" has been reduced to meaningless symbol.
Peace is not for weak; not just isolationist inaction or absence of conflict, Ruiz says.
He writes that peace is noble, contagious action practiced by those with higher purpose.
Ruiz says Americans must stand for peace in actions, in  expectations of leaders, in votes.
