"Maria" will stay in a Smile for a Child home for now, charity spokesman says.
The child "is doing much better" after being taken by police from Roma home, he says.
"The girl was found in a state of neglect, both physically and psychologically," he says.
Roma community official denies that girl was abused or abducted.
