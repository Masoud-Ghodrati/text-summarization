Bob Greene: In Ohio, highway signs memorialize soldiers felled in recent wars.
He says the Ohio General Assembly authorizes the signs; about 70 erected so far.
He says the signs for soldier's named are on highways near their hometowns.
Greene: Corporations pay millions to be named on signs; these soldiers paid dearer price.
