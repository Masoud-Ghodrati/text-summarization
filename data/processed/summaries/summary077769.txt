George Washington's first inauguration took place on April 30, 1789, and not in the city named for him.
As allowed by the Constitution, only two presidents chose to "affirm" rather than swear their oaths.
Obama will be sworn-in twice; once on Sunday in private and again on Monday in public.
Inaugurations were predominantly on March 4 until 1937. Since, January 20 is the date.
