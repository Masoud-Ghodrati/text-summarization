Aimee Copeland's dad tells how he broke the news that her hands would be amputated.
"I have never seen such a strong display of courage," he says of his daughter.
Copeland had already lost a leg and part of her abdomen to an infection by a rare bug.
She has necrotizing fasciitis, caused by a flesh-devouring bacteria she got in an accident.
