Nicollette Sheridan claims show creator-producer Marc Cherry hit her during a 2008 rehearsal.
Cherry killed off her "Desperate Housewives" character 11 episodes later, her suit contends.
Cherry says he just "lightly tapped her head" and killing Edie Britt was "a creative decision".
Eva Longoria, Marcia Cross, James Denton and Felicity Huffman are on witness list.
