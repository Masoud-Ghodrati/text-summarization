Bob Greene: Who walks away from $10 million? The composer of "God Bless America" did.
Russian-born songwriter Irving Berlin saw it as "his gift to the nation he adored," says Greene.
Berlin arranged for the song's royalties to be given away in perpetuity, Greene says.
Greene: For 70 years, the money has been donated to Boy Scout and Girl Scout programs.
