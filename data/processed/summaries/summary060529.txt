NEW: A victim's father speaks well of Tata, while calling leaving the kids "a really bad decision".
An arrest affidavit claims Tata "unlawfully and recklessly" caused "serious bodily injury".
An investigator believes an unattended oil-filled pot on an electric stove started the fire.
Witnesses say Tata had come back to the home after grocery shopping and noticed the smoke.
