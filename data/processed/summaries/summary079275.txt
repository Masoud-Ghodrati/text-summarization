The extended missile range allows Seoul to defend itself, a security official says.
The agreement allows Seoul to fire missiles up to 800 kilometers (497 miles).
At that range, South Korean missiles could strike the northern peninsula of North Korea.
Previously, the South agreed to limit its missile range in exchange for access to U.S. technology.
