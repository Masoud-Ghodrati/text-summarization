Apple settles lawsuit over in-game iTunes purchases by kids.
Parents claimed kids racked up huge bills for "freemium" games like "TapFish".
Apple will offer credits or cash refunds for people who can show their bills.
Anyone can get $5 in iTunes credit, and parents with bigger claims can receive more.
