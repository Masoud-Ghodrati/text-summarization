One man told police he was shot after answering a Craigslist ad for an Ohio job.
Nine days later, a body is found in a shallow grave near the shooting site.
2 other bodies found Friday may be linked to the same ad, authorities say.
The son of one victim says his father was "stoked" about the online job offer.
