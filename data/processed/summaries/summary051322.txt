Saudi Arabia's cabinet has approved a law to combat domestic violence at home and in the workplace.
Human rights campaigners welcome decision, but urge caution as law is unclear and not implemented yet.
Until now, Saudi Arabia hasn't had a written law governing domestic violence.
The law is expected to be implemented within 90 days, making physical abuse punishable with a maximum of one year in jail.
