Gov. Chris Christie has called for a referendum to settle the same-sex marriage issue.
Gay rights advocates argue that such issues shouldn't go to a public vote.
A recent poll found that 52% of New Jersey voters are in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage.
Six states and the District of Columbia currently grant same-sex marriage licenses.
