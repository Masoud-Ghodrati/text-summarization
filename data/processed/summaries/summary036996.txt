Senate Democrats backing off votes meant to embarrass Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana.
Votes would have highlighted Vitter's alleged past involvement with a prostitute.
Votes were possible response to Vitter plan to strip healthcare contributions from lawmakers, aides.
Senate may still hold vote on Vitter plan, which is considered likely to lose.
