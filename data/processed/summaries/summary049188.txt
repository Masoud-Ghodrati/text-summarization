Amanda Bynes is released from "inpatient treatment" after over four months.
The actress is at home in the custody of her parents, her mother's lawyer says.
"She is undergoing outpatient treatment several times a week," the lawyer says.
A judge ruled Bynes is mentally competent to stand trial for a drunken driving charge.
