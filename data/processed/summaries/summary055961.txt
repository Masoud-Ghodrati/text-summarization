Two dolphins were returned to the wild, after 5 to 6 years in captivity.
Trainers are tracking the dolphins, and they are doing well.
Two years ago, the dolphins were the main attraction at a run-down Turkish tourist park.
Lead trainer Jeff Foster worked to help release Keiko, the orca from the 1993 movie "Free Willy".
