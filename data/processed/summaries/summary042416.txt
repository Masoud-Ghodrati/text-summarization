Etta James' classic "At Last" is a popular wedding song.
Couples who featured the song at weddings pay tribute to the singer, who died January 20.
Some chose the song to show how long they dated; others because they married later in life.
See all the tributes, including one bride's rendition of the song, on CNN iReport.
