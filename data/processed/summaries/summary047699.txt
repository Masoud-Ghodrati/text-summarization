Belmoktar has long been a target of French counter-terrorism forces.
Analysts believe the attack is too sophisticated to have been planned in days.
Belmoktar earns the nickname "Belaouar" -- the "one-eyed" -- after a battlefield injury.
He allegedly is involved in smuggling drugs, weapon and people.
