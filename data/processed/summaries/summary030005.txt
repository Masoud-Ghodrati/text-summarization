Oscar Aranda has been patrolling Puerto Vallarta's beaches for the past 10 years.
He's determined to save sea turtles from poachers, who are after the turtles' eggs and meat.
In 2004, Aranda started the nonprofit group Vallarta Rescue to help his cause.
The sea turtles that nest on Mexican beaches are in danger of extinction.
