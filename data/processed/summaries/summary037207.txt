New Greek government, formed after four days of horse-trading, is country's first coalition in 60 years.
Old form of government has led to ossified political class and corruption, says Pavlos Tsimas.
This system has led to financial crisis and made it almost impossible for Greece to reform, he says.
Tsimas says presence of party that has not participated in corrupt party politics might be good news.
