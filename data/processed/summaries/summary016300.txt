Eunice Kennedy Shriver started Special Olympics in her backyard in 1962.
Special Olympics has grown into a global organization that helps 3 million athletes.
An estimated 200 million people live with intellectual disabilities worldwide.
Says one athlete: "Because we have special needs doesn't mean we can't do stuff'.
