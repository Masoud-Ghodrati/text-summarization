UPDATE: Reading, Pennsylvania, will keep the Christmas tree some called "ugly" downtown.
The "Charlie Brown" Christmas tree originally didn't live up to a Pennsylvania city's standards.
City Council President Francis Acosta helped raise money to replace the tree.
"The city deserves having a beautiful, good-spirit Christmas, and we're gonna offer that".
