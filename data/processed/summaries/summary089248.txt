Blake Hounshell: Morsy's views on 9-11, women and embassy breach worrisome.
In his U.N. debut, he touted Islamic values but also affirmed Egypt's international obligations.
He may be anti-American but will rein that in because Egypt needs money from the world, he says.
Hounshell: Morsy must help his country thrive; if he fails, then worry about religious rhetoric.
