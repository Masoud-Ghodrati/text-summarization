NEW: The singer's brother says he had been "misled by unknown reasons".
The singer was hurt in a China nightclub brawl but not seriously, manager says.
Dozens of media outlets echoed the original hoax report over the weekend.
CNN chose not to report the story because details could not be confirmed.
