Among its annual surveys, Visa Inc. looks at how much children get from the Tooth Fairy.
The fairy is most generous in the Northeast -- a tooth under a pillow pays an average of $4.10.
In the Midwest, children receive an average of $3.30 per tooth, the survey says.
The South and West fell in the middle, at $3.60 and $3.70, respectively.
