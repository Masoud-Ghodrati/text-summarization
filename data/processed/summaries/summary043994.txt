Dean Obeidallah: Can someone who is a bigot evolve? And does society then forgive them?.
He says people call Paula Deen a racist and cast her out; that's not good for society, though.
He says history is full of viewpoints evolving for the better, such as on gay marriage.
He says some of Deen's apology implausible, but public should be open to redemption.
