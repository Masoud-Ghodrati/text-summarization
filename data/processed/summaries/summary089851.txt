Small-business owners John Nicholson and Miles Fawcett do not see eye-to-eye.
Fawcett likes the plan -- he says it puts children like his ill daughter first.
Nicholson doesn't like it -- he fears his small business will choke on the regulations.
Both agree there are no easy answers to make sure everyone has health care.
