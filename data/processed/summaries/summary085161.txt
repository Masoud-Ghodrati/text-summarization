Duchess of Cambridge's first official portrait, by artist Paul Emsley, unveiled in London.
Catherine, who is expecting her first baby, posed for the picture last year.
She is a patron of the National Portrait Gallery, where the painting will be shown.
Reaction to the portrait has been mixed; many on Twitter claim it is unflattering.
