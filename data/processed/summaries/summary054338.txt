New Jersey teen asks Hasbro to use boys on packaging for Easy-Bake Ultimate Ovens.
McKenna Pope says packaging discourages boys from baking, enforces gender stereotypes.
Pope, 13, launched Change.org petition on behalf of 4-year-old brother who asked for the toy.
Activists glad that a teen is speaking up rather than usual advocates and opinion writers.
