Scottish Power Renewables has successfully tested a new type of underwater tidal turbine.
The device can produce 1 megawatt of electricity, enough to power 500 homes and businesses.
A fleet of ten underwater turbines could be installed off the West coast of Scotland.
This would be the first sub sea turbine farm anywhere in the world.
