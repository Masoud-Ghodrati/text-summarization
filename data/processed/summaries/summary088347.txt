Rep. Joe Wilson says he apologized to Obama and that should be enough.
Wilson yelled "You lie" as Obama made health care speech to Congress last week.
House Democrats plan to censure Wilson unless he apologizes in House this week.
Wilson says he respects president, "would never do something like that again".
