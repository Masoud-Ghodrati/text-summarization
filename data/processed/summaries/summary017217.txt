Former Canadian junior hockey coach Graham James sentenced to 2 years for sex abuse.
Sentence was for sexually abusing two men when they were aspiring teen hockey players.
Now-retired NHL star Theo Fleury and his cousin Todd Holt, were victims.
Sentence is "nothing short of a national travesty," says Holt.
