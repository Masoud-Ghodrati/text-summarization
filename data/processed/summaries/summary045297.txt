Ash dieback, an incurable tree disease, has been detected in the UK.
It threatens Britain's 80 million ash trees, the fourth most abundant tree in the country.
A smartphone app called Ashtag is providing a way for the public to report diseased trees.
More than 100,000 trees have been destroyed in efforts to contain its spread.
