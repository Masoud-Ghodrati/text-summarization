NEW: As of 11 p.m., Arthur is 75 miles off Cape Cod, moving northeast at 31 mph.
It should be much weaker when it makes landfall over Nova Scotia early Saturday.
The storm system produced significant rain but not as much wind as once feared.
Governor says Arthur ended up having "minimal impact" on North Carolina.
