Claims by Diana's butler that he knew "secret" about her trashed by coroner.
Paul Burrell asked to testify about the last letter the late princess gave him.
Coroner revealed Burrell's "secret" was Diana planned to buy property abroad.
But coroner said the revelation is "fairly and squarely in the public domain".
