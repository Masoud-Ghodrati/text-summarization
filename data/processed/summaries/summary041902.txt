Malala Yousafzai: After the bullets, "out of that silence came thousands of voices".
She addresses the U.N. Youth Assembly, a gathering of more than 500 youth leaders.
"I don't even hate the Talib who shot me," she said Friday, her 16th birthday.
"This is what my soul is telling me," she said. "Be peaceful and love everyone".
