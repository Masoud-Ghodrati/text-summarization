Paul Begala: Chris Christie faces difficult choice between being seen as a crook or a schnook.
He says Christie is not convincing playing the victim of his own staff.
Begala says the scandal is likely to haunt Christie because it fits perceptions of him as a bully.
The investigative and legal process will grind on, to Christie's detriment, Begala says.
