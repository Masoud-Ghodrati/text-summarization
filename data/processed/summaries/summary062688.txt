Frida Ghitis: Nadya Tolokonnikova, jailed Pussy Riot activist, has vanished.
Amnesty says she was taken from prison in car; family doesn't know where she is, she says.
Ghitis: Her band, and Putin regime's crackdown on it, shone light on Russia's repression.
Ghitis: It's feared she's in Siberia, her health at risk.  Russia making her an icon.
