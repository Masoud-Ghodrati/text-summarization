Phil Mickelson is inducted into golf's Hall of Fame on Monday.
'Lefty' has won four major titles and 40 PGA Tour crowns in his 20-year career.
Mickelson has never held the world No. 1 ranking largely due to Tiger Woods' dominance.
Golf expert David Dusek says Mickelson is one of the best players of his generation.
