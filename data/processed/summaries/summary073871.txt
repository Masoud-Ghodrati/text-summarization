Ruben Navarrette: Democrats paint Paul Ryan as down on immigration, but he's complicated.
He says nativist group gave Ryan "C" on record; he's voted for laws giving some legal status.
He says Ryan seems to see use of letting temporary workers stay for agricultural work, etc..
Navarrette: He may edge toward stricter views for campaign, but his votes so far show nuance.
