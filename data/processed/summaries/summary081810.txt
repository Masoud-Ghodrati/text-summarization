Prosecutor Gerrie Nel seeks to discredit expert defense witness Roger Dixon.
On the stand, Dixon contradicts Oscar Pistorius' testimony over position of magazine rack.
The prosecution says Pistorius intentionally shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp after a fight.
Pistorius denies murder, saying he mistook his girlfriend for an intruder.
