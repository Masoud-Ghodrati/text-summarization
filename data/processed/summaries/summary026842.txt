Emile Griffith won welterweight and middleweight titles during his boxing career.
Benny Paret died days after being pummeled in the ring by Griffith in 1962.
Griffith was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.
"He was as great a gentleman as he was a fighter," the hall's director says.
