2 Gonzaga University students say they used a gun to scare off an intruder.
The man who tried to get into their apartment -- a convicted felon -- was caught.
Having guns is a violation of Gonzaga policy; the 2 could have been expelled.
They are on probation instead; their lawyer says they'll appeal this decision.
