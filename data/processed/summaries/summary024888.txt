NEW: The EPA says ground-level air tests don't "show elevated toxic chemicals".
A city official says that any released toxins appear to pose "no threat to the public".
The Waxahachie fire chief says the fire overran the plant's sprinkler system.
A main chemical produced at the plant was anhydrous ammonia, an EPA official says.
