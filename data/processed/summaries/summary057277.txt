23 warships from NATO countries conducted an exercise in Italy this week.
NATO's military chief said ships allowed it to practice "engagement without embroilment".
The deputy secretary of the 28-nation alliance acknowledged the cost of maintaining fleets.
But commanders insisted the military deterrent forced Syria to give up its chemical weapons.
