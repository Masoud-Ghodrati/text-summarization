NEW: Publisher: "This book will give Knox an opportunity to tell her story for the first time".
Amanda Knox was cleared of murdering British student Meredith Kercher in October.
Knox returned to Seattle with her family after spending four years in custody.
Knox will give a "full and unflinching account" of her ordeal, the publisher says.
