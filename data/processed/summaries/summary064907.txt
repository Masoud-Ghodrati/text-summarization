Stella Ehrhart, 8, dresses as a different character each day for school in Omaha, Nebraska.
Favorite characters include Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, Helen Keller.
Stella says she never repeats characters because "it's better to focus on as much as we can".
All her costumes come from her closet, she and her mother say.
