Researchers in the UK say the latest discovery involving wonder material graphene could revolutionize batteries.
Graphene is 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than a human hair.
The material, which has the same atomic structure as the lead in pencils, is impermeable to atoms and molecules.
Scientists found that positively charged hydrogen atoms could pass through it with implications for fuel cell efficiency.
