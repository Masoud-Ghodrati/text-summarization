The cease-fire was brokered with the help of a sheikh and a member of parliament.
"Compared to the past, this is a state of peace and security," the sheikh says.
The parliamentarian says the cease-fire in Tal Kalakh could spread across the country.
But a rebel stands firm in his stance: "Our goal is to bring down the regime".
