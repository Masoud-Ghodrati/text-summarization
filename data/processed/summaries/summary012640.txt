The heart of the cold air is centered over Eastern Europe, a CNN meteorologist says.
More than 30 people have died as a result of the cold in Ukraine, officials say.
Even colder weather and heavy snow are forecast later this week for some areas.
The icy conditions are spreading westward across Europe.
