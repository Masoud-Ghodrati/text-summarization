Foreign Secretary William Hague: "Iran is an important country in a volatile region".
"The circumstances are right to reopen our embassy in Tehran," Hague tells lawmakers.
The embassy in Tehran was closed after an attack on the site by protesters in 2011.
Britain also shut the Iranian Embassy in London and ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave.
