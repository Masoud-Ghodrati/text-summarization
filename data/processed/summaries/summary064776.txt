Videotapes taken by Phillip and Nancy Garrido were released by prosecutors Tuesday.
DA's office: Release is part of an effort to improve "detection of sexual predators".
One clip shows children in playground as Phillip Garrido plays a guitar and sings.
In another, a parole agent searches house, some years before Dugard was found.
