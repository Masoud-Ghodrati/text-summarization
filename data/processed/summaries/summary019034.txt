David Weinberger says he's not outraged about the Rolling Stone cover.
He asks, why must we prove bombings upset us before we can discuss not minding cover?.
He says cover assumes that we all agree bombings were an act of a monster.
Weinberger: Cover confronts the mystery of someone like us who came to hate us.
