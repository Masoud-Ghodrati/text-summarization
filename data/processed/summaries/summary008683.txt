Jay Parini: New HBO series takes off on novel based on Christian idea of 'the rapture'.
He says it's a fun TV idea, but the rapture concept is rubbish made up by theologian in 1800s.
The idea is that Jesus will come back, collect "saved" people before tribulation time begins.
Parini: Bible doesn't mention rapture. It's proponents distort apostles' metaphors to cook it up.
