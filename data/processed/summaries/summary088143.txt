Amer Deghayes, 20, is the eldest of four Brighton youths known to have gone to fight in Syria.
He told CNN he had been inspired by European recruits taking up arms in Syria's civil war.
The British government says it will crack down on what it calls the "flow of foreign fighters".
A bereaved mother says it's the responsibility of all to prevent young men traveling to war.
