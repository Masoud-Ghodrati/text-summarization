Iran may find it difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year.
It falls one week to the day after the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri.
Montazeri, a key figure from the 1979 revolution, was an opponent of the current regime.
Ashura marks the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, grandson of Mohammed.
