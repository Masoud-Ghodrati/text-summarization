The U.S. DVD cover art for an Australian film about Aboriginal soul singers has been criticized.
The image places the Aboriginal actors in the background, while foregrounding the white lead.
The U.S. distributors have apologized for the image.
Some said the criticism was unjustified, as the white actor was the film's best known.
