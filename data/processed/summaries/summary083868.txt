Joran van der Sloot marries a woman who he met as she visited his Lima prison.
The couple are expecting a child together in September, according to his lawyer.
Van der Sloot pleaded guilty in 2012 to the murder of a 21-year-old Peruvian woman.
He was arrested twice, but never charged, in Natalee Holloway's disappearance.
