Holden Frith says one story recounts how the Apple logo was a tribute to Alan Turing.
"Sadly, the truth is rarely as simple, or beautiful, as we would like," he writes.
Apple logo artist Rob Janoff is charmed by the story but was unaware of the association.
Frith: More than most, Steve Jobs appreciated the value of a beautiful story.
