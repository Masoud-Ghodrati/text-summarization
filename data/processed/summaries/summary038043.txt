The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting her second child, Buckingham Palace announced.
"Throughout history, the only way to secure a throne has been with a phalanx of children".
Aristocratic wives were once told they needed to provide an "heir and a spare" at least.
The second child has a vital role in carrying out royal duties and obligations.
