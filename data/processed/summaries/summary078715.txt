The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George are visiting NZ and Australia.
Prince George had a play date with 10 babies in Wellington on Wednesday.
The 8-month-old prince was described by one onlooker as "quite a bruiser".
He didn't scream or break anything but did grab a toy from one of the other children.
