Jacmel, seaside town of 40,000 about hour from Port-au-Prince, is Haiti's cultural capital.
An estimated 10 percent of the town's residents were killed in the quake.
The town has also lost its cultural buildings, paintings and masks that drew tourists.
Young filmmakers put skills to work, get the word out of Jacmel's plight.
