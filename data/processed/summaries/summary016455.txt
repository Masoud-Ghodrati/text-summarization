NEW: MI6 chief apologizes "unreservedly" to spy's family for failure to act quickly.
Gareth Williams was poisoned or suffocated in the bag in which he was locked, coroner says.
The bag containing his naked body was put into a bath by an unknown person, coroner rules.
His family calls for an investigation into the secret services' role in the investigation.
