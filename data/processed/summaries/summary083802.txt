A 32-year-old man died after being assaulted Sunday by a group, at least 1 with a hammer.
Three juveniles have been arrested; police are still looking for a fourth suspect.
St. Louis mayor: "No evidence" that victim's race or ethnicity was related to attack.
Francis Slay: It isn't the fault of police that suspects' kin didn't know they were out so late.
