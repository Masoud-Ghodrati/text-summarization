Republicans likely won't reappoint congressional budget director Doug Elmendorf when his term ends next month.
Two ex-CBO directors say the office will remain nonpartisan, but others worry the hyperpartisan environment could change the calculus.
The next CBO director could have a big impact on key pieces of legislation, from budget negotiations to Obamacare.
This comes despite Elmendorf's high ratings among both right- and left-leaning economists.
