NEW: Marian Thompson gets 2 spotted leopards, 2 macaque monkeys and a brown bear.
Last year, an Ohio man freed dozens of animals from his farm before committing suicide.
Law enforcement killed 48 of the released animals, and 2 primates were killed by the other animals.
The 5 animals that were returned Friday weren't among those released last year.
