Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced significant cuts to the U.S. Army.
Michael Desch: Defense Department, military can't be exempt from budget cuts.
Desch: Personnel costs are huge; Army has most members so will bear the brunt.
He says drone attacks, special op warfare are the future, not "boots on the ground".
