Philadelphia Police Sgt. Robert Ralston confessed to making up story to get attention or transfer.
Ralston reported he was shot during encounter with African-American males on train track.
Inconsistent evidence trapped Ralston, Commissioner Charles Ramsey says.
Ralston suspended with intent to dismiss; no criminal charges in exchange for confession.
