Diwali is a Hindu festival that takes place between mid October and mid November each year.
Lights are lit to commemorate the legend of the return of the Hindu god Rama to his kingdom after 14 years in exile.
Hindus also believe Lakshmi, goddess of wealth, enters their homes during this period.
In Indian villages Diwali is more a celebration of the end of the harvest and many months of hard work.
