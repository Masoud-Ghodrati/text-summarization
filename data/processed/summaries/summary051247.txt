Mississippi Supreme Court denies a bid to rehear a case on controversial pardons.
The latest decision is issued "without comment," a court spokeswoman says.
Critics say state rules and victims' rights were violated by over 200 pardons in January.
But courts have consistently upheld the pardons, some of which went to convicted killers.
