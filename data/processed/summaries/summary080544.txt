In Damascus, people watch as tracer fire lit up the sky.
Locals were annoyed we were not seeing the best of their city.
We tried to avoid contact with security officers but needed their help with road directions.
Young fighters laughed with me; now after sustained attacks I don't know how many are still alive.
