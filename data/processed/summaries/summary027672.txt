Anti-government protester Majid Tavakoli recently arrested.
Iranian news agency then published picture of Tavakoli dressed in a chador.
Government critics say the picture was doctored and meant to humiliate Tavakoli.
To show solidarity, Iranian men post pictures of themselves with head scarves on Internet.
