There is a distinct Italian flavor pervading "The Screening Room" this month.
We asked Rome-based critic Lee Marshall to nominate his top 10 Italian films.
He chose classics like "La Strada" by Fellini and "L'Avventura" by Antonioni.
As well as Moretti's "Dear Diary and Sorrentino's "The Consequences of Love".
