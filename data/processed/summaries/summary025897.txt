John Boulachanis, 37, was arrested in Miami, the U.S. Marshals Service says.
Canadian authorities say he shot a man in the head in August 1997.
The hunt for him picked up this spring, two years after he was seen in New Jersey.
Besides murder, he is wanted on fraud, arson, conspiracy and drug trafficking charges.
