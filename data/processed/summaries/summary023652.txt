Cleric Maulana Samiul Haq says Karzai asked him to mediate talks with the Afghan Taliban.
Haq is known as one of the spiritual leaders of the Taliban movement.
President Karzai, in Pakistan for talks, has not commented on the cleric's claim.
The Taliban deny that there have been meetings with the Afghan government.
