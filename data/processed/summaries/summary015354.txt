Charles Taylor is the first African head of state to appear before an international war crimes tribunal.
He is accused of fueling a bloody civil war in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone.
"He indicated he was deeply upset and needed to rest," a court spokesman says of the boycott.
Taylor has pleaded not guilty to charges that include crimes against humanity.
