Donna Brazile: 96-year-old Tennessee woman lacks papers required for new voter ID law.
She says the woman had voted for 70 years; the new mandate disenfranchises her.
She says GOP push for voter ID's is affecting the elderly, the poor and minorities.
Brazile: GOP leaders are more interested in winning than protecting citizens' right to vote.
