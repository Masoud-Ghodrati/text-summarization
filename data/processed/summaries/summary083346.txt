Colleen LaRose, accused of conspiracy, was depressed about father's death, police say.
Last year, LaRose agreed to kill a resident of Sweden, indictment says.
She went to Europe in 2009 "in an effort to complete her task," Justice Department says.
LaRose's former boyfriend says circumstances surrounding her arrest are "really crazy".
