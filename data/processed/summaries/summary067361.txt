It is unclear whether anyone was killed in the attack, a U.N. official says.
Attackers looted a displaced persons camp and raped women there, the official says.
The attack comes after U.N. monitors confirm that rebels have withdrawn from Goma.
The rebels were told by regional leaders to withdraw at least 12 miles from the city.
