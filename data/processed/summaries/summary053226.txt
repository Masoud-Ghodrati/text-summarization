Mark and Ismini Svensson were planning a big wedding reception and honeymoon when they had a change of heart.
The New York couple is spending their wedding budget performing 50 acts of kindness -- one in each state.
They took to social media for suggestions and drove to each location.
They have visited 36 states and have 14 more to go.
