Therapist and blogger Nikki Walton helps women find confidence with their natural hair.
Walton's written a book, "Better Than Good Hair," to guide women in their hair journey.
The keys for her have been regular trims and low manipulation.
Embracing one's natural texture can improve your quality of life.
