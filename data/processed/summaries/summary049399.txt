Former international rugby star Gareth Thomas of Wales reveals that he is gay.
The 35-year-old is the sport's first high-profile name to acknowledge being homosexual.
He married his childhood sweetheart in 2002 but they are separated and getting divorced.
Thomas retired from internationals in 2007 as Wales' most-capped player.
