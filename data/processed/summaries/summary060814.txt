Evan Wood: Conservatives concerned by spending ignore cost of failed war on drugs.
$2.5 trillion spent on war on drugs; crime, violence, drug use are the result, he says.
Taxation on marijuana could generate $1.4 billion a year in  tax revenue, writes Wood.
Americans more likely to report marijuana use than people in Netherlands, he says, where it's legal.
