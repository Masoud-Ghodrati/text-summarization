A powerful 9.0-magnitude earthquake struck northeast Japan on March 11, 2011.
It unleashed a massive tsunami and triggered the world's worst nuclear crisis in 25 years.
A moment of silence will be held at the exact moment the quake hit.
Prime minister says "steady progress" is being made on cleanup and reconstruction efforts.
