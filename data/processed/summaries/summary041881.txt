Mike Downey: David Ortiz may have been the scariest thing to face Cardinals this Halloween.
"Big Papi" was awesome at the plate: 11 hits in 15 official times at bat before Game 6.
Downey: Cardinals had to walk Ortiz four times in the final game; they lost anyway.
Red Sox claimed the series as their own in large part due to Ortiz, Downey says.
