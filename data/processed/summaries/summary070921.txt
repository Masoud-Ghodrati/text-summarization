Mike Tyson will present Evander Holyfield at induction into Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame.
In a memorable 1997 boxing match, Tyson bit off a piece of Holyfield's ear.
Apparently bygones are bygones; they appeared in a recent TV commercial together.
Others being inducted include George Foreman, Sonny Liston, Joe Louis, Jack Dempsey.
