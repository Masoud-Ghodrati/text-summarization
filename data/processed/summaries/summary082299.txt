Candidates for U.S. Senate in Mass. are seeking to prevent deceptive super PAC ads.
Kathleen Hall Jamieson: Such ads could be stopped nationwide if TV stations refused to air them.
She says stations are required to air candidates' ads, but not those of independent groups.
Jamieson: Ads that distort candidates' records shouldn't be given air time.
