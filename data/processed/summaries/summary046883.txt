Spain's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape victims or women who would suffer lasting harm.
Anthony Ozimic says no unborn child is unworthy of legal protection against abortion.
Having an abortion does not "unrape" a rape victim, he says, or cure an illness.
Ozimic says if unborn children are human beings, then abortion is Spain's leading cause of death.
