Zoo group says 3,000 to 5,000 zoo animals, from tadpoles to lions, are killed each year.
Zoo says it tried to move two of the four lions elsewhere, but "there wasn't any interest".
Three other lions will "be the foundation of the zoo's next lion era," says zoo chief.
The same zoo prompted outrage when it killed a healthy male giraffe to prevent inbreeding.
