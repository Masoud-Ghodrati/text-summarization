Birdwatchers discover previously unknown species of bird in Cambodia.
The Cambodian Tailorbird was photographed near a construction site in Phnom Penh.
The rare find indicates there may be more species yet to be discovered in the region.
Until now, 50 years of human conflict had made parts of Indochina off-limits to bird watchers.
