An attack on Bolshoi Theater's artistic director has put the institution in the spotlight.
Phil Black says the theater's general director and a dancer are fighting for control.
Dancer Nikolai Tsiskaridze has had two warnings for speaking to media without permission.
A court has overturned one, but Tsiskaridze says he is fighting for the Bolshoi's future.
