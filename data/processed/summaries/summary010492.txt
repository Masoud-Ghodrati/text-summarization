Deputy Gelhaus "honestly and reasonably believed" his life was in danger, prosecutor says.
The shooting of Andy Lopez was "lawful self-defense," District Attorney Jill Ravitch says.
"These cops can get away with murder," protester says.
Lopez carried a replica AK-47 when he was shot to death last October.
