President Barack Obama says he has "no sympathy" for violence after a grand jury did not indict the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown.
Obama called on protesters to fight for political change and new policies to improve relations with police.
Attorney General Eric Holder says the Justice Department's two civil rights reviews in Brown's shooting will continue.
