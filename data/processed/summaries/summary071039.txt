Civil Rights Summit April 8-10 at LBJ Library honors 50th anniversary of civil rights laws.
Luci Baines Johnson's father, LBJ, signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act on her 17th birthday.
She stood behind him as he signed the Voting Rights Act; he taught her justice of the law.
Her dad wanted U.S. to be "blind to color," where education, opportunity is unaware of color.
