Aaron Miller: U.S. deal to free Bergdahl was ugly, but it was moral and necessary.
He says when U.S. sends troops into harm's way, it's responsible for them.
U.S. weakened its hand by making deal, he says, but it reflected nation's values.
Miller: We need to face that we had the conviction, courage to act, no matter how messy.
