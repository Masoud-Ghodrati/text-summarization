Christophe de Margerie was Chairman and Chief Executive of Total.
He died when his Dassault Falcon 50 jet hit a snow plow at an airport in Russia.
De Margerie "was a shrewd oil and gas man, who loved to take Total into new frontiers".
He was warmly known as Mr. Moustache due to his trademark giant walrus-sized patch.
