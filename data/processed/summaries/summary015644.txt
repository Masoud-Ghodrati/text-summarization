At least 418 people have died as a result of Typhoon Bopha, Filipino officials say.
That includes 142 people in the town of New Bataan, the government reports.
Some residents in the remote area didn't hear warnings, others ignored them.
Survivors are in desperate need of water, food and shelter, a relief worker says.
