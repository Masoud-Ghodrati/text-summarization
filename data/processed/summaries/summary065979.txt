Newly-rescued Sauber team have been awarded the 13th place on the F1 grid.
Motorsport's governing body the FIA says Sauber will take the place of Toyota in 2010.
Toyota have decided to pull out of motor racing's premier category due to the recession.
BMW had also pulled out but were bought out by former owner Pete Sauber.
