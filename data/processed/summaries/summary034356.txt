John Avlon: Michele Bachmann distorted the truth at CNN debate.
He says she wrongly said the CIA's interrogations had been outsourced to ACLU.
Her claims that Obama avoid energy independence and killed pipeline are wrong, he says.
Avlon: Bachmann plays politics by "talk show rules," aiming for impact, not accuracy.
