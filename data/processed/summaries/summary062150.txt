Hospital exec says nurses didn't ask Thomas Eric Duncan what African country he visited.
Duncan left the emergency room but died October 8 of Ebola virus.
The hospital didn't conduct any simulations on how to handle Ebola cases, executive says.
"We are certainly forthcoming and transparent about the fact that we missed a diagnosis".
