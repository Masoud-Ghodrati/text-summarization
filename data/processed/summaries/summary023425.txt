A painting of the teenager is being shown at the National Portrait Gallery in London.
Artist Jonathan Yeo calls her "one of the most inspiring figures of our age".
He has donated the work to the Malala Fund, which was set up to help girls go to school.
"I think that he has really captured me in the image," Malala says of the portrait.
