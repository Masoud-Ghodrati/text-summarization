CNN Latino welcomes Emmy-winning journalist Elizabeth Espinosa as new host.
For the first time Espinosa will be broadcasting to her fellow Angelenos in Spanish.
"It's almost as if I'm doing a reverse crossover, right? I can't wait," says Espinosa.
CNN en Espa√±ol launches CNN Latino on Monday in Los Angeles.
