Melissa Nelson worked as a dental assistant for James Knight for more than 10 years.
The Iowa Supreme Court rules the dentist acted legally when he let her go.
Nelson was fired because Knight and his wife felt she was a threat to their marriage.
The all-male high court rules her termination did not constitute unlawful discrimination.
