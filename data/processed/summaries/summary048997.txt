The city of Tshwane in South Africa is installing pre-paid electricity smart meters.
The city has endemic problems of late payment, long-term debtors and electricity theft.
It's hoped smart meters will bring much-needed investment in the sector.
Poor electricity infrastructure in places like Africa or India makes energy theft easy.
