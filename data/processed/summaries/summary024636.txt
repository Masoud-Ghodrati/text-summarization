King Abdullah II says he doesn't expect al-Assad regime to crumble immediately.
He says only the Syrian president can stop the country from sliding into civil war.
If civil order breaks down completely, he says, "it will take years to fix Syria".
He raises concerns that Syria's chemical weapons might fall into terrorist hands.
