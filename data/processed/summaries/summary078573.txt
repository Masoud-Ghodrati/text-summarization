A young Christian girl in Pakistan was accused of burning text from the Quran.
Feisal Abdul Rauf: Muslims should not be angry at the girl, they should show compassion.
He says Pakistan must not allow a handful of extremists to define Islamic values.
Rauf: Islam is a religion of peace and justice; Muslims must live up to its standards.
