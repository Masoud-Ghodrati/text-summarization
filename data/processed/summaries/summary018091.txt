Fan group states opposition to Russian club Zenit St Petersburg signing black players.
Group says "we see the absence of black players at Zenit as an important tradition".
Zenit say they have been distinguished by their tolerant approach to diversity.
Zenit spent millions on black players Hulk and Axel Witsel back in September.
