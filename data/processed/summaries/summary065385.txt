A record 1,020 rhinos have been poached in South Africa in 2014.
Veterinarians and rangers are relocating rhinos in the country's Kruger National Park.
Rhinos are targeted for their horns, which are wrongly believed to have medicinal value.
Insatiable demand in Asia means rhino horn is worth more per ounce than gold, platinum.
