NEW: Mark Martin, Joey Logano, Keith Olbermann and others salute the late NASCAR driver.
Richard "Dick" Trickle, a veteran racer, burst on the NASCAR scene in 1989.
North Carolina authorities get a call saying "there would be a dead body and it would be his".
They find Trickle's body, dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
