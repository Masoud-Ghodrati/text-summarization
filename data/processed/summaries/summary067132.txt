Environmental group claims Chinese delegation went on an ivory buying spree in Tanzania.
It cites local traders saying the ivory was sent back to China on the presidential plane.
China's government has not responded to CNN requests for comment on the claims.
Tanzania lost equivalent of 30 elephants a day in 2013, environmental group says.
