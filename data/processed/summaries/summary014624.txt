Gene Seymour: Neil Armstrong was a star test pilot, cool and decisive under stress.
He says Armstrong chose not to exploit his historic role as the first man on the moon.
After leaving NASA, he taught aerospace engineering at the University of Cincinnati.
Seymour: Armstrong refused to sell out himself, or his legacy, despite the temptations of fame.
