Eurovision outfits have become more flamboyant since the advent of televoting.
The "Barbara Dex Award" is an annual prize made by a fan site to the worst dressed artist.
The award is named for Belgium's 1993 entry who performed in a homemade dress.
The first unorthodox outfit was worn in 1958 by Margot "Miss Jukebox " Hielscher.
