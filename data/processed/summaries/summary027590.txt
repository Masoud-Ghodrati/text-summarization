Marc Marginedas hasn't been in touch with his newspaper since Sept. 4.
The paper says it appears he was kidnapped by militants in western Syria.
No group has claimed responsibility for his kidnapping, the newspaper says.
Amnesty International has said Syria is the most dangerous place for journalists.
