Sepp Blatter isn't corrupt nor is he a dictator, says Jerome Champagne.
Former diplomat is bidding to replace 78-year-old as FIFA president in 2015 elections.
Champagne says FIFA needs "fresh air" but issue is not Blatter.
The 56-year-old also urges FIFA to make report into World Cup bidding process public.
