Hoffman withdrew $1,200 from a supermarket ATM, law enforcement officials say.
The actor was seen at a number of his regular haunts the day before his death.
Some people say he seemed normal; others say he appeared to be high or "out of it".
He was found dead Sunday morning with a syringe in his arm, sources say.
