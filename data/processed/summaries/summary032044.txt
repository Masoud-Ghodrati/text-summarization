Democrats' system includes about 800 superdelegates -- party officials, leaders.
Unlike elected delegates, superdelegates can vote for any candidate they choose.
Some says they fear superdelegates could tip balance against the popular vote.
If such a thing happens, some say voters will feel alienated, disenfranchised.
