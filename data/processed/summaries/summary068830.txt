Gambler returning from Macau reportedly left around U.S. $256,000 in the back of a cab in Hong Kong.
The driver turned it into police, who then tried to track down the rightful owner.
Hong Kong law dictates that after three months, the police may return property to the finder.
But the police declined to hand over the cash saying they were still investigating.
