Indian man is accused of killing 3-month-old baby girl because he wanted a son.
The United Nations says India is the most dangerous place to be a girl.
It's common to abort female babies because boys are seen as 'better investments'.
For every 1,000 boys 6 years and under, there are 914 girls -- the lowest ratio since 1947.
