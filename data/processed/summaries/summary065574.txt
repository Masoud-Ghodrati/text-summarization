Donald Trump files countersuit seeking $400,000 from J. Taikwok Yung of Brooklyn.
Yung filed a complaint in 2011 seeking to keep four Trump-related domain names.
Memorandum filed on Thursday calls Yung a "brazen" and "unrepentant" cybersquatter.
Law prohibits registering well-known trademarks with intent to profit from rightful owners.
