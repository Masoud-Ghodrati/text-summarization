Sister Helen Prejean, portrayed in "Dead Man Walking," wants court to review death row case.
Mississippi court denies request to set Michelle Byrom's execution for Thursday.
She's on death row for allegedly plotting to murder her husband, but her son has confessed.
Byrom has "suffered a lifetime of abuse" and "struggles with mental illness," writes Prejean.
