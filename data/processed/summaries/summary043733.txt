Editor of the Italian magazine Chi defends its use of photos of the Duchess of Cambridge.
The photos show her in "a small bikini that enhances her now visible (baby) bump," Chi says.
A disappointed St. James's Palace says the pictures violate her privacy.
Chi was among the publications to run photos of Catherine sunbathing topless last year.
