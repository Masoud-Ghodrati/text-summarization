PM Francois Fillon: "This warning should not be dramatized".
Ratings agency Standard & Poor's took away France's top-tier AAA credit rating Friday.
Eight other euro area countries -- including Italy -- were also downgraded by the agency.
"France is a safe country, a country which investors can trust," Fillon says.
