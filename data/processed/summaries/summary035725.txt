Preliminary charges in the Spain train crash will now include top railway officials.
Judge Luis Alaez Legeren is adding the charges because the train lacked a safety system.
He notes there were systems in place at various places, but driver error was not anticipated.
The crash took the lives of 79 people and injured some 170.
