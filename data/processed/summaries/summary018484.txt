Oscar Pistorius is indicted in a Valentine's Day shooting death.
Monday would have been the 30th birthday of Reeva Steenkamp, his dead girlfriend.
Pistorius says he mistook her for a home invader when he shot her in February.
The Olympic sprinter's trial will begin in March 2014, a prosecutor says.
