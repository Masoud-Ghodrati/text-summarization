Danny Cevallos: Bradley Manning case may test law on gender identity change in prison.
A federal court ruled that prisoners must be granted care for gender change.
Cevallos: The test is whether denial of care amounts to "cruel and unusual punishment".
He says other courts have differed on the issue; the law is not fully settled.
