Jeremy Roberts, 38, will be charged with murder in his ex-wife's death, police say.
"He just ran outside and killed my mom," Roberts' 13-year-old son told a 911 dispatcher.
Roberts got on the phone, calmly telling police he had stabbed his ex-wife.
The son who called 911 is haunted by what he saw, his older sister says.
