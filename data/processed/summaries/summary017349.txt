On January 13, half a million demonstrated against gay marriage in Paris.
Protests took place a week before Obama mentioned gay rights in inauguration speech.
French have pessimistic vision of marriage compared to Americans, says Philippe Coste.
French only consider assisted reproduction for treating infertility, says Coste.
