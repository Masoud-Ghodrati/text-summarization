Workers are being lured to work in factories producing electronic goods but have to pay a fee to secure the job..
After that they are in debt and have to work to pay it off, sometimes being forced to surrender travel documents..
Malaysia is a major manufacturer of electronics but supply chains are not properly regulated, says Dan Viederman of Verit√©..
He wants all companies to end forced labor in their supply chains..
