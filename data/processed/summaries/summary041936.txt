Ireland's budget airline has made a profitable habit out of incensing passengers.
Carrier says it will remove some lavatories from its planes to make room for extra seats.
Ryanair has not announced a date to implement the plan.
Previous announcements: charging for lavatory use, standing-room-only option.
