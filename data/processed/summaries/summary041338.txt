13 plaintiffs, including four U.S. vets, sued in 2010 after being stopped from traveling in aircraft.
The plaintiffs say they believe they are on the federal no-fly list.
They call other means of travel, such as boat trips lasting more than a month, impractical.
The ACLU hails the ruling; the Justice Department would not comment on the case.
