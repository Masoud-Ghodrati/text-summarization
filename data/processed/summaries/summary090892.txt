Hillary Clinton reached back to Hurricane Katrina to herald Mary Landrieu on Saturday.
"She was relentless," Clinton said of the senator's work after the 2005 storm.
The former first lady also knocked President George W. Bush in her speech.
Landrieu touted her 18-year experience in the Senate, despite a national anti-incumbent mood.
