The Monument Quilt consists of more than 250 stories from survivors of rape and abuse.
The brainchild of activist group FORCE, Monument Quilt is visiting 13 cities this summer.
FORCE helps community groups display quilt, hold quilt-making workshops.
The goal of the project is to create healing spaces by and for survivors.
