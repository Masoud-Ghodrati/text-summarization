"The Square" is filmmaker Jehane Noujaim's documentary about Egypt's revolutionaries.
It's told through the eyes of three revolutionaries who meet in during the first protests.
This is the Egypt the Obama administration has forgotten, says Cynthia Schneider.
Schneider: Film should be a painful reminder to the U.S. of the military regime it backs.
