30 were detained after a protest at a Gazprom oil platform in the Barents Sea.
Greenpeace says two activists tried to hang a banner from a rig.
Russia: The action endangered lives, and could have led to an environmental disaster.
The activists are "accused of an imaginary offense," a Greenpeace official says.
