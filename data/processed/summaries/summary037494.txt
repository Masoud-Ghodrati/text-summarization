Michael Dunn entered his plea during a hearing Monday at the Duval County, Florida, jail.
Dunn case has been compared to the "stand your ground" case involving Trayvon Martin's death.
"There are no comparisons to the Trayvon Martin situation," Dunn's lawyer says.
Dunn said he felt threatened by the teens, but no guns were found inside their car.
