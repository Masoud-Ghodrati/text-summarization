Santiago Iniguez Olivares accused of bludgeoning Modesta Navarro Nieves because he thought she put a spell on him.
Olivares had been on the run until recently, when he returned to the area because he thought murder had been forgotten.
Authorities arrested a woman in June 2008 in central Mexico on charges she had killed another woman for similar reasons.
