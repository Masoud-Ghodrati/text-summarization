In August, King Abdullah ordered Khalid bin Mohsen Shaari to be treated in Riyadh, the capital.
He then weighed 1,345 pounds and had not left his bed for three years, magazine says.
Heart and lungs are better, and he has less inflammation and stronger muscles, doctor says.
Shaari still can't move on his own and uses a mechanized pulley to sit on a big wheelchair.
