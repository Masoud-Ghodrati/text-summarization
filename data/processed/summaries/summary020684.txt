"Crown Forces Watch" had called for people to post pictures of police officers.
Police Federation of Northern Ireland said publishing pictures was an attempt to "target police officers for murder".
The page appeared after a series of recent police raids and arrests.
Police Federation calls for those involved to be prosecuted.
