A boy, 10, is arraigned in a California court on charges of murder and felony assault.
He is being held in a juvenile detention center, a district attorney spokesman says.
The mother of the alleged victim, 12, claims her son died trying to break up a fight.
She describes her son as intelligent and caring, adding he was "everything to me".
