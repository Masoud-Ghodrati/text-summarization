Four government ministers were forced to resign after being tainted by a corruption scandal.
Erdogan has denounced the corruption investigation as part of an "international conspiracy".
Fadi Hakura says the allegations relate to a power struggle between Erdogan and a cleric.
He says it has disrupted their informal coalition and may lead to a more robust democracy.
