Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants FAMU president James Ammons to step down amid hazing investigation.
The FAMU trustees chairman says a "very difficult decision" will be made Monday.
FAMU has been a focal point since last month's death of a drum major after alleged hazing.
Authorities found evidence of "financial irregularities" at the school, a state official said.
