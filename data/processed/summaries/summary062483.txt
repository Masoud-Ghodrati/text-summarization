Over a billion people around the world expected to participate in events to mark Earth Day.
Conservation efforts, environmental rallies and educational programs unite under the banner.
This year, organizers are trying to create "A Billion Acts of Green".
First Earth Day was conceived by U.S. senator Gaylord Nelson and took place on April 22 1970.
