Leopoldo Lopez has long been a threat to socialists in Venezuela.
In 2008, President Hugo Chavez's government banned him from seeking public office.
Lopez turned him in this week after the government accused of him terrorism, murder.
Prosecutors formally charged him with arson and conspiracy; dropped more serious charges.
