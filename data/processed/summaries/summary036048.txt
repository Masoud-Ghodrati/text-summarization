"Night Film" is the latest thriller from best-selling author Marisha Pessl.
Pessl's novel centers around a reclusive horror director and the reporter out to expose him.
Pessl wrote and directed several short online films offering clues to the book's plot.
"Night Film" is drawing comparisons to last summer's best-seller "Gone Girl".
