McCartney: Friendship "fell apart" after Jackson purchased the Beatles catalog.
McCartney asked for a raise from Jackson but Jackson didn't respond, he says.
The former Beatle says there was "no big bust-up," contrary to rumors.
"He was a lovely man, massively talented and we miss him," McCartney said.
