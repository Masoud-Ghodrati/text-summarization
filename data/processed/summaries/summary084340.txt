10 women were detained for "performing a religious act contrary to the local customs".
The women were wearing shawls that only men are allowed to use at the wall.
Women of the Wall calls for equal wall access for all Jewish practices and denominations.
The group says that only in the past 22 months have police detained or arrested the women.
