Brown allegedly was driving a car that rear-ended another car in Los Angeles in May.
He faces charges of hit-and-run driving and driving without a license.
"I have a valid drivers license and I gave the woman the right info," Brown tweets.
Brown already faces a probation violation hearing related to his assault on Rihanna.
