Luay al-Khatteeb says ISIS now controls 60% of Syria's oil assets and a slice of Iraq's.
The oil is sold through black market routes, particularly into Turkey.
Iraq appointed a new oil minister this month, who could help crack down on ISIS.
al-Khatteeb says the minister can assist by backing big oil projects that create jobs.
