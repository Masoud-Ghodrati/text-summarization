NEW: Former trader Kweku Adoboli is sentenced to seven years in prison.
Adoboli was convicted Tuesday on two counts of fraud and acquitted on four other charges.
His actions constituted "pure and simple" fraud, a prosecutor says.
He was charged in connection with a $2.3 billion loss in unauthorized trading at UBS.
