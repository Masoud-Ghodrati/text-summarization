At least 15 hurt in factory blast, hospital says.
The explosion happened Monday afternoon at a ball bearing plant in southern New Hampshire.
None of the injuries appears to be life-threatening, a company spokeswoman says.
The factory makes bearing assemblies for aircraft, medical equipment and high-tech industries.
