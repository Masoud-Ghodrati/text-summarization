Peter Bergen: It was easier for the U.S. to kill bin Laden than to kill his ideology.
The Boston bombing is one case in which bin Laden's ideology may have played a role, he says.
The majority of Muslims reject bin Ladenism, but there are still some adherents, he says.
Bergen: Syrian conflict is another arena in which bin Ladenism is active.
