Robert Schwartz tells of 9-year-old tried as adult; he was put on probation, received no treatment.
Schwartz: Jordan Brown should not be tried as an adult for crime committed at 11.
Writes: Kids incompetent to be tried as adults; trying them as juveniles not excusing crime.
It's in society's enlightened self-interest, Schwartz says, to try youngsters in juvenile court.
