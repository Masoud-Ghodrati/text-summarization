Camacho was shot in the face two days ago in front of a bar in his hometown in Puerto Rico.
His family is now weighing whether to remove him from life support.
The southpaw fought professionally for more than 25 years and last stepped into the ring in 2010.
He had a career record of 79 wins, six losses, and three draws.
