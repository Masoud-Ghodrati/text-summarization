Visit to Zimbabwe was prompted by an appeal from Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai.
Tsvangirai asked for S. African leader's help in solving a "constitutional crisis".
Tsvangirai has accused President Robert Mugabe of making unilateral decisions.
One delegate says visit is simply part of a "broader task to monitor" the situation.
