Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly contracted Ebola while helping others in Liberia.
Both were flown home to the U.S. and are being treated at Emory University Hospital.
Nancy Writebol's husband says she's not yet in the clear but "in very good hands".
Kent Brantly says his "focus ... remains the same -- to follow God".
