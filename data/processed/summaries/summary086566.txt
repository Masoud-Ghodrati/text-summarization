A photo of a child in a Ray Rice costume dragging a Janay Rice doll surfaced on Instagram.
"Utterly disgusting" is the sentiment shared by many parents about the costume.
Many parents say hypersexualized costumes for girls are also inappropriate.
"Just because it's Halloween that doesn't mean you can cross these kinds of lines," said one tween.
