Fernando Alonso won't buy cycling team Euskaltel Euskadi after negotiations end.
The Spanish outfit must now find another major sponsor to keep afloat.
The two-time Formula One champion says he still wants to be involved with a cycling team.
He didn't rule out starting a team from "scratch" and looked ahead to 2015.
