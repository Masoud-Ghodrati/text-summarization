The Guardian newspaper says it has obtained a top secret court order.
The order gives the NSA blanket access to records of millions of Americans, the newspaper says.
The order, issued at the request of the FBI, is valid April 25 through July 19, The Guardian says.
Al Gore, the ACLU and others are criticizing the order.
