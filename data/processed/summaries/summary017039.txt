Two and a half years after running aground in Giglio, Italy, the Costa Concordia is being re-floated.
32 passengers and crew were killed when the cruise ship capsized in January 2012.
Crews hope to re-float the Concordia and tow it from Giglio to the port in Genoa.
Dismantling the ship could take two years; the total cost of the wreck is projected to be more than $2 billion.
