The UK government has announced a Â£10 million fund to research driverless cars.
Transport Minister Claire Perry says the technology could be "transformational".
But James Foxall says driverless cars are programed but humans are random.
Driverless cars sharing the road with human-driven vehicles could be chaotic, he says.
