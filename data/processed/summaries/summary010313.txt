Wayne Rooney's father is one of nine men arrested over an alleged betting fraud.
The England striker's uncle and Motherwell's Steve Jennings also arrested by police.
All nine people have been released on bail until January next year.
The allegations concern a Scottish match between Motherwell and Hearts in 2010.
