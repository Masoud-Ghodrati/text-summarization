At Cannes Film Festival, at least, the film critic is still alive and kicking.
CNN's Neil Curry speaks with Hans-Georg Rodek critic for German daily Die Weldt.
Of criticism, Rodek says: Humanity doesn't really need it but it makes life easier.
He added: Cannes is the only place on earth where you can see really exciting films today.
