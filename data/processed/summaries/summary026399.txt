Miguel Angel Jimenez is set to return to action at this week's Spanish Open.
The Spaniard has been out of action for three months after breaking his leg in a ski accident.
The 49-year-old is the oldest man to have won on the European Tour.
Jimenez insists his career will not be a failure if he does not win a major.
