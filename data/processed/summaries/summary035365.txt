Marsha Johnson: This election season, it seems like politicians are continually "doubling-down".
She says this term is meant to seem strong, but just avoids fessing up.
She says we like strong leaders, but want them to be self-aware; it's not weak to admit flaws.
Johnson: The longer a leader takes to admit flaw, the more some will turn against them.
