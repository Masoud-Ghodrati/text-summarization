Former U.S. soldier Tony Vaccaro carried a camera with him while fighting in WWII.
Vaccaro shot 8,000 pictures of what he saw on way from beaches of Normandy to Berlin.
Photos show devastation left in wake of conflict, but also joys of liberation.
The former G.I. became a professional portrait photographer after the war.
