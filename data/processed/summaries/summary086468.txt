The bear was left in the departure lounge of Bristol Airport over a year ago.
With it was a photograph, dated 1918, showing two small children with a bear.
Efforts by airport staff to trace the owners of the bear have so far failed.
"It is obvious the bear has been well loved for many years," airport spokeswoman says.
