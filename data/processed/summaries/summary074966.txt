CNN's Pete Dominick once worked with Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.
Dominick wasn't talking to his pals; he was out Saturday observing folks attending rally.
Dominick finds that a good sense of humor is what attendees had in common.
Funny signs he spotted: "God Hates Nags," "Hitler was a total Nazi".
