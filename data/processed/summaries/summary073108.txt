HLN anchors Nancy Grace and Jane Velez-Mitchell were the targets, authorities say.
David Lee Simpson allegedly targeted the two because of their coverage of the Jodi Arias trial.
Simpson, 48, was indicted on charges of stalking and computer tampering.
He was arrested in New York and waived extradition to Maricopa County, Arizona.
