Barbara Arnwine, Stephanie Jones: We are heartened by two recent acts of justice.
Decisions on mandatory minimums and "stop and frisk" racial profiling are right, they say.
Arwine, Jones: Congress should follow up by passing the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2013.
The act would not force judges to impose a "one size fits all" penalty on offenders.
