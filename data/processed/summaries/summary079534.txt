Benjamin Larson of LaCrosse, Wisconsin, died in the Haiti quake, his family said Thursday.
Larson, his wife and cousin, all seminary students, were in Haiti helping with a church school.
The building in which they were staying collapsed, and Benjamin Larson did not escape.
"He ... built love and community wherever he was," his mother says in a statement.
