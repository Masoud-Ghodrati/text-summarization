NEW: At least 325 people have died as a result of Typhoon Bopha, officials say.
The government says 180,000 people are in shelters.
Bopha is moving offshore but is still raking northwestern Philippines with heavy rain.
The typhoon comes almost a year after a storm killed more than 1,200 people on Mindanao.
