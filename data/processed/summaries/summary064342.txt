One of the most interesting solar events, a rare hybrid eclipse, happened over the weekend.
Partial eclipse was visible in the early morning Sunday in eastern North and South America.
Skygazers in parts of Europe, Africa and the Middle East could see it too.
The hybrid eclipse was only visible from parts of Atlantic Ocean and equatorial Africa.
