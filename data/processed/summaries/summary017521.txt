Professional dancer Mark Ballas is paired with Melissa Joan Hart this season.
The two-time champ of "Dancing With the Stars" finds her "bright and bubbly".
Ballas: Paula Abdul would be great as a contestant, but isn't needed as a judge.
Maksim Chmerkovskiy and Karina Smirnoff's breakup won't affect the show, he says.
