This month, IME focuses on animals and their role in the culture and daily life of the region.
For centuries animals - from camels to desert falcons - have provided food, transportation, and even companionship in the harsh, isolated land..
We visit an animal shelter, a luxury pet hotel, a lion whisperer, a falcon hospital and Cairo's rooftop pigeon fanciers.
