A man, 57, has died after being attacked by a crocodile in Australia's Northern Territory.
Police said the man apparently entered the Adelaide River after his fishing line snagged.
Guide Peter Saltmarsh said the crocodile nicknamed "Michael Jackson" was well known.
The 4.5 meter crocodile, which was subsequently shot, had a pale head and dark body.
