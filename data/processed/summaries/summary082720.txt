FTC official: Skechers' claims "went beyond stronger and more toned muscles".
They also said shoes would help "weight loss and cardiovascular health," official says.
Customers who bought Skechers "toning" shoes will be eligible for refunds.
Sales of toning footwear approached $1 billion industrywide in 2010, FTC says.
