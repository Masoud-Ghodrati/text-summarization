Attorney asks why police would think Jonathan Ferrell was robber when he approached.
Police fatally shot the 24-year-old after woman called 911 to report home invasion.
Ferrell had been involved in a serious wreck a block away and was seeking help, attorney says.
Fiancee called Ferrell "Sweets" and said he made people smile, cared for others.
