China halts imports of milk powders produced by a New Zealand company.
The import ban comes after a botulism-causing bacteria was found in the product.
Milk-powder maker Fonterra is the world's largest exporter of dairy products.
No reported illnesses yet; Fonterra says it's working with client companies.
