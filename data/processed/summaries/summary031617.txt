Raul Reyes: NY Mayor de Blasio says cops won't arrest someone with small amount of pot.
They'll get summons instead. It's good step, but doesn't address racial aspects of stops, he says.
Reyes: New rule requires court appearance. Miss it, and there'll be arrest warrant. This a flaw.
Reyes: De Blasio, show your progressivism. Take bold stance in favor of pot decriminalization.
