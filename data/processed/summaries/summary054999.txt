North Korea says it will launch a rocket as early as next week.
It says it's aimed at putting a satellite in orbit, but others say it's a missile test.
A South Korean government official says internal pressures are driving the plan.
The official cites recent statements from Kim Jong Un evoking the idea of uprisings.
