Officer Kenton Hampton is accused of brutality in three arrest cases, an attorney says.
Hampton is placed on paid leave, a police spokesman announces Friday.
The third allegation was made Friday by a 27-year-old man who says he was falsely arrested.
One of the three cases involves the death this summer of Kelly Thomas, a homeless man.
