NEW: At least 10 Turkish soldiers were killed Tuesday in a suspected PKK attack.
12 killed in PKK ambushes last weekend; Turkey says it's killed hundreds from PKK recently.
International Crisis Group says casualties are the highest in 13 years.
The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, launched insurgency in the 1980s in response to state bias.
