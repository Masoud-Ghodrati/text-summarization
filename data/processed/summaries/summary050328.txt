Turkish police target IHH offices as part of an operation against al Qaeda.
Leaders of the charity suggest the investigation is the work of "Israeli infiltration".
In 2010, the IHH led ships that sought to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza.
More recently, the Turkish charity has provided aid across its border to war-ravaged Syria.
