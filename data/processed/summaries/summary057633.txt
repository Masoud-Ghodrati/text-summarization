The target of the threat says that it came amid a discussion on gun control.
James Eric Fuller is in a county medical services unit, a sheriff's department spokesman says.
Fuller made threats at a town hall event being taped for a TV program, the department says.
Fuller was shot at last weekend's massacre in Tucson.
