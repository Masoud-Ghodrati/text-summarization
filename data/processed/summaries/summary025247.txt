State prosecutors have not brought charges in shooting death of Trayvon Martin.
Nicolaus Mills says the news that the federal government will investigate is welcome.
He says in 1964, the Civil Rights Division was able to obtain convictions in three killings.
Mills: The current federal investigation could help establish facts, defuse tensions.
