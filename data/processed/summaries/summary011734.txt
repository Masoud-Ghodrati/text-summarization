On Friday, Joran van der Sloot stands trial in Peru for killing a young woman.
His lawyer says van der Sloot admits killing her, but "there was no premeditation".
He was in a "post-traumatic state" that day, 5 years after Natalee Holloway went missing.
The victim's father has said van der Sloot has seemed "indifferent," not "remorseful".
