Andrew Greene's lawsuit seeks more than $25 million damages from filmmakers.
Movies portrays Greene as "a criminal, drug user, degenerate," lawsuit says.
Suit criticizes the film for mocking Green's toupee in an "egregiously offensive manner".
Complaint says it's "readily apparent" Nicky "Rugrat" Koskoff is based on Greene.
