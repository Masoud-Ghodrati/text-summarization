Ousted Thai PM Yingluck Shinawatra will face impeachment proceedings.
Yingluck was dismissed by a court Wednesday over reassigning a security official.
Analysts warn of a potential resumption of political violence in response to rising tensions.
A grenade was thrown at the house of a judge who dismissed Yingluck; noone was hurt.
