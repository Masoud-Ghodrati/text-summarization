Dad of underwater baby on Nirvana album dishes details on 1991 photo shoot.
"If you don't pull them up, they will drown," joked dad, a certified lifeguard.
Photographer Kirk Weddle chose baby's photo from pictures of 11 other kids.
Actual photo shoot lasted only 18 frames, said dad. "We got paid $200".
