Bo Xilai set to be tried at the local Intermediate People's Court in Jinan.
Former political star faces charges of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power.
Jinan is far away -- more than 780 miles -- from Chongqing, Bo's former powerbase.
It will be Bo's first public appearance since April 2012 when he was stripped of his posts.
