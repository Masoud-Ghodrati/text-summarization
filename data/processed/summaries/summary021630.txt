The victim awoke as another passenger was assaulting her with his hands, prosecutors said.
She reported the incident to flight attendants, as did a third passenger who saw the assault.
A 49-year-old New Jersey man was arrested when the plane landed.
That man was convicted Friday and could be sentenced to life in prison.
