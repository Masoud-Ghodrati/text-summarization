The U.S. ambassador to Syria says the U.S. has provided $210 million in humanitarian aid.
The assistance has to be discrete, he said, to protect workers from being targeted.
Washington has also provided $35 million worth of assistance to Syria's political opposition.
Ambassador: We can help, but it's up to Syrians to find their way forward.
