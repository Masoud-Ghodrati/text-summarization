ISIS has published four issues of online magazine detailing its aims.
Peter Bergen says the group is stressing its territorial ambitions and sectarian approach.
Unlike al Qaeda, which recruits terrorists vs. the West, ISIS wants to be a state, he says.
Bergen: ISIS is focused on sustaining and extending its insurgencies in Syria and Iraq.
