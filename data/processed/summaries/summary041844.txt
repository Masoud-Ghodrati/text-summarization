Sheriff's Office: Five set off on first day of crabbing season and are hit by a "rogue wave".
Four are found unresponsive in the frigid water; the fifth clings to a rocky outcropping.
That 66-year-old man is rescued by helicopter with minor scrapes and cuts.
No one aboard the capsized boat was wearing a life vest.
