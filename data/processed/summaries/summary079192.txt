Jenna McCorkell is an 11-time British figure skating champion from Northern Ireland.
McCorkell was included in the Great Britain team when she was just 10 years old.
She's preparing to compete in her second Winter Olympics at Sochi in February.
The 27-year-old says it is "insane" how skating is evolving.
