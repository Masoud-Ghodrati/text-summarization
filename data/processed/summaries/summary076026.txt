The Dubai Airshow matches Paris and Farnborough as an important aerospace event.
This year's show will be held at the new $32 million Al-Maktoum International Airport.
In previous years, the show broke records for most deals made.
It's rumored this year will break more records, as Emirates might buy $30 billion worth of Boeing's 777X jetliner.
