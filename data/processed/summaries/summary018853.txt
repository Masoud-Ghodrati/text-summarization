Dennis Rodman and N. Korea agreed to two games between U.S. and N. Korean players.
Daniel Pinkston: Rodman has built up trust with leader of an isolated and paranoid country.
He says with the extreme scarcity of trust on the Korean peninsula, the games are a good start.
Pinkston: Denying civil society engagement with N. Korea won't solve any problems.
