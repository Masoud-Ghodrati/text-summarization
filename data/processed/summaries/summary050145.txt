Sharon Camp: Secretary Sebelius' overrule of FDA on emergency contraception wrong.
She says FDA study was thorough, found over-the-counter sale of Plan-B safe.
She says Sebelius incorrectly invoked girls of 11 using it; less than 1% have intercourse.
Camp: Half of U.S. pregnancies (and 82% of teens) are unplanned. Ruling a step back.
