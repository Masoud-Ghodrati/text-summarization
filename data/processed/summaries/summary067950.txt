Ed Bark: Jay Leno still No. 1 in late night for NBC, but network replacing him with Jimmy Fallon.
He says NBC says it's Fallon's time, and that may have much to do with social media.
He says Fallon, O'Brien can deliver Twitter, other followers that Leno, Letterman can't.
Bark: Network making it clear that's important. But can it turn social media sway into money?.
