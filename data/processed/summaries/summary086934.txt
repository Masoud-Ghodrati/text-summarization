Construction work on the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium started 70 years ago today.
Stadium is set to undergo spectacular refurbishment should existing plans go ahead.
Arena will have increased capacity, a hotel and retail, leisure and restaurant zones.
Plans are in danger due to an ongoing legal investigation.
