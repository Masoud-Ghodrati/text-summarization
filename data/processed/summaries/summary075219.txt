Police said in 2011 that Milly Dowler's voicemail hacked by News of the World.
Dowler was 13-year-old murdered by Levi Bellfield in southwest London.
Milly described in court as funny and bright girl with normal family life.
But she was troubled to have discovered her father's pornography recently.
