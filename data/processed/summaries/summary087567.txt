National Security Adviser Tom Donilon says Obama got "divided counsel" on raid.
Relying on a "circumstantial case," the president gave the go-ahead the next morning.
Donilon says the amount of intel gathered is "about the size of a college library".
He says there's no evidence Pakistani authorities knew that bin Laden was there.
