A Michigan man who served in Iraq was denied a vanity plate saying "INF1DL".
Danny Cevallos says it ran afoul of Michigan rule banning "offensive" plates.
He says states have no business dictating what words people can put on their plates.
Cevallos says vanity plates in general are a bad idea -- states selling people ad space.
