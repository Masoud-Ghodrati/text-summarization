Michaela Angela Davis calls Cuban's comments clumsy, but tepid next to Sterling's.
Cuban, she said, acknowledged inherent prejudices while Sterling denies them.
Sterling's character was formed in an America battling the birth of the Civil Rights era, she says.
Davis: It pays for Sterling to be racist, so it would be better for him just to own up to it.
