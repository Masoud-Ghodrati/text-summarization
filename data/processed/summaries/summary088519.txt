Barbara Mancini is charged with helping her terminally ill father, 93, die in February.
She handed him morphine, he took it and fell into a coma; a hospice nurse called police.
Father was revived at a hospital as his daughter was arrested; he died 4 days later.
An advocacy group is pushing the Pennsylvania attorney general to drop the charges.
