Tom Sparks, a 33-year-old Californian, died November 5 of an apparent stroke.
His father released a statement that it was probably caused by a pre-existing condition.
The Los Angeles coroner's office told CNN they can not confirm the cause of death.
Sparks was first sent to the hospital after taping an episode of "Wipeout" in October.
