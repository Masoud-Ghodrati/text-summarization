Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, once considered Hezbollah's spiritual leader, died Sunday.
Frances Guy wrote on blog that she left the presence of Fadlallah feeling a better person.
"The world needs more men like him, willing to reach out across faiths," Guy posted.
British foreign office yanked blog post; said Guy was expressing personal views.
