Nakoula Basseley Nakoula is set to be released Thursday from a federal halfway house.
He'd been there and in a federal prison for violating his probation in a bank fraud case.
Those violations came to light amid the uproar over his film, "The Innocence of Muslims".
That movie spurred virulent anti-American protests in nations around the Islamic world.
