Albert Pujols is leaving the Cardinals, and St. Louis should be relieved, Jeff Pearlman says.
Pujols may be worth a $254 million contract with the Angels, but he's a pain, Pearlman says.
Pearlman says he's seen few pro athletes who show more disrespect for loyalists.
Pujols was St. Louis' Zeus, and nothing negative could ever be said -- until now, he says.
