British-born singer Joe Cocker died aged 70 after a battle with lung cancer.
Cocker had hits with "You are So Beautiful" and "Up Where We Belong".
Cocker conducted himself with rare professionalism and courtesy, Curry says.
"A man confident in his craft, unassuming in demeanor and impeccable in manners".
