Revolights are a set of wheel-mounted LEDs which increase cycle visibility.
The project raised five times the goal funding on Kickstarter in 2011.
Now the team is looking to Kickstarter again to develop wheels with in-built lights.
The lights are timed to blink depending on the speed the bike goes, preventing them from blinding riders.
