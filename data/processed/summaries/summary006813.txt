A U.S. missionary died in northern Mexico of one gunshot to the head, an autopsy reveals.
Gunmen in a black pickup were working with others in two other trucks, police say.
Nancy Davis and her husband had lived in Mexico since 1970s as missionaries.
"They breathed Mexico. That's their love," a friend said of the couple.
