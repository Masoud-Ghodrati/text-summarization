Zappos is trying out holacacy, an organizational system that does away with hierarchy.
David Logan: Holacracy tries to fix many things we all hate about companies.
He says as a company gets larger, innovation per person tends to go down.
Logan: Holacracy might just work at Zappos because of its unique culture.
