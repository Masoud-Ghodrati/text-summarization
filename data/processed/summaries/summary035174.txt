Radical Ukrainian nationalist leader Oleksandr Muzychko was killed Monday night.
Followers hailed him as a national hero and a Robin Hood for Ukrainians.
Paramilitary units under Muzychko sparked the alarm of Russia's Vladimir Putin.
Putin says he fears these "fascists" will attack ethnic-Russians living in Ukraine.
