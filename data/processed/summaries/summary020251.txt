Activists in Saudi Arabia have turned to social media to speak out against the government.
The establishment of independent human rights bodies inside the country is forbidden.
Activists risk harassment and imprisonment says Human Rights Watch (HRW).
HRW: "It's time for other countries speak up and tell Saudi Arabia to end its repression campaign.".
