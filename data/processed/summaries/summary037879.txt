"I feel like I gain a little bit of strength every day," nurse Amber Vinson says.
Vinson says she followed the CDC's rules when caring for an Ebola patient.
She says she has "no idea" how she contracted the virus.
She defends her decision to travel on commercial flights, saying she had no symptoms.
