A broad coalition of groups has filed a lawsuit against the National Security Agency.
Suit asks a federal judge to halt NSA's "unconstitutional program of dragnet electronic surveillance".
Plaintiffs include church groups, gun owners, human-rights groups and free-speech advocates.
The lawsuit is at least the fourth challenging the government's surveillance program.
