Line up for African football's showpiece event, the Cup of Nations, to be determined by Sunday.
Nations Cup has moved from even to odd years in a bid to avoid clashing with World Cup.
Tournament accounts for roughly 75% of Confederation of African Football's revenue.
Only one of West African giants Ivory Coast and Senegal can qualify.
