Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin attacked GOP hopeful Joni Ernst last week.
Ernst called his comments offensive in an interview with Fox News on Monday.
Ernst is locked in one of the most competitive Senate races this year in Iowa.
A poll released Monday showed Ernst and Democratic challenger Bruce Braley tied.
