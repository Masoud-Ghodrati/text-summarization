Sri Lanka produces a 400-page response to U.N. allegations that it committed war crimes.
The U.N. report says the government used "widespread shelling" that killed many civilians.
Sri Lanka's response will be presented to Parliament, though the president did not say when.
The country's civil war ended in May 2009 after the government declared victory.
