A new exhibition aims to show the former splendor of Orient Express.
The iconic train's first voyage was in 1883, and it connected Paris to Istanbul with stops on the way.
The train's luxurious carriages welcomed royalty, business elites and celebrated artists.
It also inspired many novels such as Agatha Christie's "Murder on the Orient Express".
