Ibrahim Boudina, a French national from Algeria, was arrested earlier this year on the French Riviera.
He and a French-Tunisian friend are suspected of having joined up with ISIS in Syria.
It was believed they fled ahead of a crackdown on a suspected terror cell based on Mediterranean coast.
Authorities were worried the duo could pose a threat if they returned to France.
