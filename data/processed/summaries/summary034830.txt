Josh Hardy is in critical condition at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.
There is a drug that may help him, but the drug company is refusing.
The company's president says he has kids too and feels for Josh's family.
Helping Josh and others like him could slow efforts to get the drug on the market.
