NEW: The Lonmin mine is not producing ore, an executive vice president says.
The owner gives striking workers another day to come back to their jobs.
A miner says he and his co-workers should stay on strike to honor dead colleagues.
44 people have been killed in violence at the mine, including 34 by police Thursday.
