Ahmet Davutoglu: U.S. airstrikes in Syria were necessary but not enough to beat ISIS.
"If ISIS goes, another radical organization may come in," he says.
All terrorist threats and "crimes against humanity" committed by Syria must end, he says.
"We will do everything possible" to help "our brothers and sisters" in Kobani, he says.
