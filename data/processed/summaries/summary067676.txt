A 93-year-old man is charged with being an accessory to at least 300,000 murders.
Prosecutors in Germany say he removed luggage left by new arrivals at Auschwitz.
He was tasked with counting any cash found and sending it to Nazi HQ in Berlin.
Prosecutors says the man must have known that those arriving would be murdered.
