Faith Gonsalves, 26, founded a music and arts program for underprivileged children in Delhi.
Gonsalves: Music is a powerful tool for children's development; raises awareness of poverty.
Delhi's formal education system has gaps when it comes to music and arts, she says.
In six years, at least 600 children and 200 musicians have participated in the program.
