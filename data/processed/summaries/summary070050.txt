Wladimir Klitschko will defend his three heavyweight titles against David Haye.
The British fighter will put his WBA belt on the line in Hamburg on July 2.
Long-awaited bout has been on cards since 2009 when Haye pulled out due to injury.
It had been in doubt after Klitschko agreed to fight Haye's compatriot Dereck Chisora.
