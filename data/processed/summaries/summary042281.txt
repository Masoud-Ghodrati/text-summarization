Zhu Ling was studying at Tsinghua University in 1994 when she was poisoned.
Now almost 40 years old, Zhu is mostly bed-ridden and is practically blind.
Suspicion turned to her roommate who wasn't charged due to lack of evidence.
A petition to the White House urges U.S. officials to investigate the case.
