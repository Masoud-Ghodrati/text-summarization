More than 250 dolphins have been herded into a cove by fishermen, U.S conservationists say.
The bottlenose dolphins are being selected for captivity or slaughter, they say.
Local officials have previously defended hunting of dolphins in Taiji, Japan, as traditional practice.
U.S. envoy to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, says she's "deeply concerned" by inhumane killing.
