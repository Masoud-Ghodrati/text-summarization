Gene Seymour: Robin Williams' death seems so implausible. How could he, of all people, stop?.
He says Williams was a force of nature who harnessed the voices in his head for comedy.
He says he was also a good--sometimes great--film actor. He empathized with his audience.
Seymour: What on Earth will it be like tomorrow without knowing he's still around?.
