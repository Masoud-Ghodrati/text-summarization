Former Germany international footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger comes out as gay.
The 31-year-old says he wants to further the debate about homosexuality in sport.
Hitzlsperger played at the World Cup and European Championship for Germany.
He said the viewpoint that "gays are soft" was a common and misplaced clichÃ©.
