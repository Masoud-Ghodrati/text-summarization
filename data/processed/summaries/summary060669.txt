Started as a simple four -- shoyu, shio, tonkotsu and miso, ramen grows into dozens of local styles.
Not all ramen in Hokkaido is miso but there are also shoyu ramen from Asahikawa and curry ramen from Muroran.
Every sunset, ramen carts are set up along the rivers in Tenjin, Kyushu, selling pork-bone ramen till the next morning.
