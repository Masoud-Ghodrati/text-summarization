NEW: Amada Knox and her former boyfriend "killed for nothing," a prosecutor in their appeal says.
Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing Briton Meredith Kercher.
Their attorneys argue police made mistakes and evidence does not support their convictions.
Amanda Knox is scheduled to speak on Monday.
