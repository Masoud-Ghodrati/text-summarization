Tailgating is a tradition at many colleges, passed down from generation to generation.
Many tailgates include games, food and an entertainment system.
At the University of Washington, fans can tailgate on the water.
Tigers fans -- both Auburn's and LSU's -- invite opposing teams to their tailgates.
