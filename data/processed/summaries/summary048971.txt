Randy Phillips is on the witness stand for a fifth day in the Jackson wrongful death trial.
Jackson's family says AEG Live is liable in the death because of its ties to Dr. Conrad Murray.
Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death.
AEG Live says Jackson controlled Murray and it didn't know Jackson abused drugs.
