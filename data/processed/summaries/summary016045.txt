Irish Mayor Darren Scully resigns after saying he would no longer represent people of black African origin.
He said the black Africans were aggressive towards him and accused him of not standing up for them.
As a result, he said on radio, he had decided to actually stop representing them.
Opposition parties demanded he step down as mayor of Naas.
