It's been an emotional time for the parents of castaway Jose Salvador Alvarenga.
His mother, Julia, said her son didn't keep up, and they didn't even know he was missing.
"I would pray to God, and I won't lie to you, I was crying," she says.
For the excited residents of his town in El Salvador, Alvarenga is a hero.
