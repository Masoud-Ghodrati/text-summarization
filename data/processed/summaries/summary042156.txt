Dierks Bentley: His friend and inspiration, country music legend George Jones has died.
He says listening to Jones means "hearing" him; his words filtered through a broken heart.
He says in Jones' catalog you can hear what great country does: reaches out, consoles.
Bentley: Jones part of country's "greatest generation." Thank them while you can.
