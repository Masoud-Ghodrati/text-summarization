Netanyahu was never serious about peace talks, Palestinian official says.
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel won't take part in negotiations backed by Hamas.
"I call on President Abbas: Tear up your pact with Hamas," Netanyahu says.
Netanyahu says he will "seek other ways" to achieve peace if necessary.
