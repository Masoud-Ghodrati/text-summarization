Lessons from 1970 DC-9 ditching into Caribbean, 1996 crash off Comoro Islands.
DC-9 seat belt failure lead to new design; jet didn't have enough life rafts.
Passengers in 1996 crash inflated vests before getting out, were trapped.
A320s have a  "ditching button" to close valves, allowing jet to float longer.
