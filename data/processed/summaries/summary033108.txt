A baby in Israel, a Palestinian kindergartner and an American-Palestinian youth killed last week.
It's a déjà vu of the killings of youths before the Israeli-Gaza conflict this past summer.
Back then, three Jewish teens were found killed.
A Palestinian youth was burned to death in what Israeli prosecutors have called a revenge killing.
