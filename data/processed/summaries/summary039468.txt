Australian environment minister says report rings alarm bell for Great Barrier Reef.
Report says half the reef's coral coverage has disappeared in the last 27 years.
Factors blamed include cyclones, coral bleaching and the crown-of-thorns starfish.
Starfish outbreaks hinder reef's ability to recover from cyclones.
