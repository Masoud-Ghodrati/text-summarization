Matt Fitzpatrick will be one of six amateur golfers lining up at the Masters this week.
The 19-year-old qualified by winning last year's U.S. Amateur Championship.
Fitzpatrick made the cut at last year's British Open and was leading amateur.
He has turned his back on a U.S. college scholarship to focus on his game.
