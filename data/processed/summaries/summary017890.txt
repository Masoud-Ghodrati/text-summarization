China has hinted it's rethinking its system of "re-education through labor".
In 2009, around 190,000 Chinese were locked up in 320 centers, according to a UNHRC report.
System dates back to the 1950s when communist regime swept up "counter-revolutionaries".
Accused offenders can be jailed for up to four years without a judicial hearing.
