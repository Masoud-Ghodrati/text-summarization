Police fatally shot John Crawford, a young black man holding an air rifle, in a Walmart.
Jesse Williams: 911 caller wrong when he said Crawford was pointing and loading "gun".
Williams: Crawford's killing once again shows racist assumptions about black men.
Williams: Data show cops shoot first, ask later when it comes to blacks, an injustice to all.
