F1 returns at the British Grand Prix on 30 June following the death of a marshal in Montreal.
Marshals are unpaid volunteers who give up their free time to ensure driver and crowd safety.
There will be close to 1200 marshals at the British race at Silverstone.
Motor races could not be held without marshals.
