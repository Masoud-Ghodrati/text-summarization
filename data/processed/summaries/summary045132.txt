NEW: Jury deliberations resume Monday in Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.
Don't convict "Murray for the actions of Michael Jackson," defense says.
Defense blames "everybody but Conrad Murray, poor Conrad Murray," prosecutor says.
Jury must decide if Murray used an IV drip or if Jackson injected himself with overdose.
