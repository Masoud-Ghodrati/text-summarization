Myanmar is facing a food shortage largely due to last year's deadly Cyclone Nargis.
Cyclone destroyed nearly all the rice crops in the fertile Ayeyarwaddy delta.
Rice production in the cyclone-affected areas expected to be half of last year's.
Despite adequate crops this year, food access remains a problem for the poor.
