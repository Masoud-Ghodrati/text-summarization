World No. 1 Tiger Woods admits he's had to adapt his game the older he gets.
"I know that I don't have 20 years in my prime," says winner of 14 major titles.
Woods hasn't won a major championship since the U.S. Open in 2008.
The 38-year-old starts his season on the PGA Tour this weekend in La Jolla.
