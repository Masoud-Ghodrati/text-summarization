Mohamed Morsy and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood members will stand trial next month.
Morsy faces charges related to his alleged involvement in violence, state media reports.
He has been kept in detention since the military removed him from office in July.
The U.S. may announce it is cutting some military aid to Egypt, U.S. officials say.
