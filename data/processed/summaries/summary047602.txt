Quinton "Randy" Keel was a civilian mortician at Dover Air Force Mortuary.
He sawed off the arm of a dead Marine without consulting the family.
He was a supervisor who "illegally" tried to punish whistleblowers, investigators say.
Officials are awaiting Air Force decisions on the two other supervisors.
