Lin says he is "extremely excited and honored to be a Houston Rocket again".
He thanks the Knicks and New York for their support during the "best year of my life".
The Knicks would not match the Houston Rockets' $25 million offer for the point guard.
New York recently signed two other guards, Raymond Felton and Jason Kidd.
