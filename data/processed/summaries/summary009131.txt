Stacey Addison was detained by police in September during a taxi journey.
She says another passenger in the cab picked up a package containing drugs.
Addison spent her birthday this week in a prison where she is being treated for an abscess.
"It's been a nightmare. We just want her to be able to come home," her mother tells CNN.
