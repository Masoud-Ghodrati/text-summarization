Frida Ghitis: Obama administration confirmed Syria regime used chemical weapons.
Ghitis: This crosses Obama's "red line;" will he act? Possible to do so without U.S. forces.
She says arming rebels with values similar to U.S. one option; another is no-fly zones.
Ghitis: Not acting would legitimize use of chemical weapons, upend U.S. authority.
