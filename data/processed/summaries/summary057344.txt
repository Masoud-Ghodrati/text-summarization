International Criminal Court is wrong to ask for Saif al-Islam Gadhafi's surrender, Libya says.
Libyan authorities want to try the son of late strongman Moammar Gadhafi in Libya.
ICC defense lawyers say Gadhafi has been mistreated and should be handed over now.
Libya and the ICC have been arguing over his case since his arrest last November.
