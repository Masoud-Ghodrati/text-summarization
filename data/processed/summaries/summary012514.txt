Maria Cardona: Gas prices low ahead of holiday weekend, but we know it can change quickly.
She says prices tied to global markets, not amount of U.S. drilling. We should rely less on oil.
She says Obama fuel standards will save millions; Congress stalls other laws that would help.
Cadona: Are we willing to wait for the next oil price shock, or do we want to take action?.
