Amir: the fate of a former Marine can push the U.S. and Iran into a military conflict.
He says that the incident of American sailors rescuing Iranian fishermen is a diplomatic feat.
Amir: what if the whole rescue incident was an act of God?.
He says many in Iran dream of an Iranian Spring, they do not want war with the U.S. (or Israel).
