Peter Bergen says a terrorist killed in a U.S. drone strike continues to influence jihadists.
He says it was easier for U.S. to kill Anwar al-Awlaki than to eliminate support for his ideas.
Suspect in Boston bombings downloaded al-Awlaki's articles and his magazine, Bergen says.
Bergen: Many other charges have been brought against followers of al-Awlaki.
