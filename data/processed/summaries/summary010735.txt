The Ivory Coast's Laurent Gbagbo will not step down, his foreign minister says.
The official dismisses as unlikely a threat by West African leaders to use force against Gbagbo.
On Friday, that group said it may have "no alternative" but to use "legitimate force".
The international community has called Gbagbo illegitimate and accused his forces of abuses.
