Paul Sracic: Are Democrats now reconsidering their vote in the 2008 Democratic primary?.
Hillary Clinton's favorability rating is now sky-high at 69%, Sracic says.
Prospects for many Democratic elected officials in 2012 are now rather dismal, he says.
Still, only Mitt Romney appears to be a significant challenge to Obama, Sracic says.
