Molly is a drug that used to be the powder or crystal form of MDMA, or Ecstasy.
Now, Molly is more often made up of a toxic mix of lab-created chemicals.
Almost all the chemicals in Molly and other synthetic drugs come from laboratories in China.
The DEA says using Molly is like playing Russian roulette.
