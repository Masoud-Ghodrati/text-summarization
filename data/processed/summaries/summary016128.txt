America's Kentucky Derby horse race will take place on Saturday.
Known as the "Run of the Roses" after the garland of flowers draped over winners.
It dates back to 1875, where African-American jockey and trainer won the first race.
Despite its international standing, the race keeps its unique local flavor.
