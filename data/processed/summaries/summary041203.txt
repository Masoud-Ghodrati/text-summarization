Soccer star Pele should be taken off dialysis early Sunday, hospital says.
He went into hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, this week for a urinary tract infection.
The hospital says the 74-year-old is getting better as he's being treated in the ICU.
Pele is a three-time World Cup champion and shared Player of the Century award.
