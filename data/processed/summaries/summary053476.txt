Kimberly Norwood, a black woman and lawyer, lives in a suburb 12 miles from Ferguson.
She has been ignored or seen as shoplifting risk in stores, as has her young daughter.
She notified police when her sons were walking to school so they wouldn't harass them.
Norwood hopes Ferguson will start conversation on black Americans' daily experiences.
