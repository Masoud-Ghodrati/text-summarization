A man abducted as a boy by the Lord's Resistance Army says it's time to bring its leader Joseph Kony to justice.
Jacob Acaye was featured in the film "Kony 2012" which has renewed public interest in the Ugandan warlord.
He took CNN to a village near Gulu town to show the hut from where he was abducted by the LRA.
He successfully escaped after watching his brother be executed for a failed escape attempt.
