Democrats have pointed to early January as a symbolic date for Clinton's presidential aspirations.
If Clinton doesn't say 'no' by early January 2015, people close to Clinton say, it will be a sign she is running.
Clinton said in September, that she will 'be making a decision around - probably after - the first of the year'.
