Carol Anne Laletta Bond is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge.
She used poisons to try to get back at a woman who had an affair with Bond's husband.
Attorney: "I didn't think that the federal government had any role to be in this case".
Justice Department says Bond's action falls under an international chemical weapon treaty.
