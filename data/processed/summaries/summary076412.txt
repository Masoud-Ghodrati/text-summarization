Dilip Donde is the first Indian sailor ever to attempt a round-world solo voyage.
Donde has had to battle giant waves and furious winds on his almost-year-long trip.
If he successfully completes the voyage, he will arrive back in Mumbai in mid-May.
The sailor spoke to CNN about fear and his various states of mind.
