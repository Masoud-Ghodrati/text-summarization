NEW: Hospital releases first photographs of Malala since she was admitted for treatment.
Malala understands where she is and wants to thank people for their support, hospital says.
Malala is communicating through written notes; she can't talk because of a tracheotomy tube.
She was shot after she defied the Taliban by insisting on girls' right to education.
