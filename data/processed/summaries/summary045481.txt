"Three Studies of Lucian Freud," painted in 1969, sold for $142,405,000.
Christie's says it's the most money ever paid for a piece of artwork at an auction.
The previous record for a work of art sold at an auction was Edvard Munch's "The Scream".
The sale was part of an auction with the highest sale total in history.
