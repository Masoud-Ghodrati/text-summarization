Anti-war and Occupy Wall Street-aligned protesters march in Washington.
Some tried to enter the Air and Space Museum over its military drone display.
A guard pepper sprayed after another guard was pushed, a museum official says.
The museum closed early Saturday, but is set to reopen on time Sunday.
