The first Rolling Stones documentary, 1965's "Charlie is My Darling," has been released.
The film captures the band mates, all in their 20s, on the edge of super stardom.
Filmmaker Mick Gochanour uncovered the earliest footage of "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction".
Gochanour: "It was like finding a Picasso in Grandma's attic".
