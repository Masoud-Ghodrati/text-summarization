Thousands in Cairo's Tahrir Square erupt in cheers as Mohamed Morsi is named president.
Educated in the United States, Morsi has long been a behind-the-scenes party figure.
He has argued for barring women from the presidency and called Israeli leaders "vampires".
Morsi leads the Freedom and Justice Party, political wing of Muslim Brotherhood.
