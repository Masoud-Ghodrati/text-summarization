Frida Ghitis: Scientists tell us optimism is good for us. Let's not be delusional.
She says "it's all good" ignores when things aren't; worrying leads us to fruitful action.
She says Chamberlain in WWII a good example of blind optimism; FDR example of useful optimism.
Ghitis: Optimism for suckers; pessimism often better. We need to work for happy endings.
