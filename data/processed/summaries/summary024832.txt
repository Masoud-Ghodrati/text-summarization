Lois Goodman is described by her attorney as "the dean of the tennis officials".
Last August she was arrested while in New York preparing to work the U.S. Open.
Los Angeles police accused her in the blugeoning death of her husband.
Charges were later dropped, the USTA reinstated her, and she will work this year's Open.
