Nicolas Sarkozy served as France's president between 2007 and 2012.
Two months after he left that post, authorities raided his home and office.
An investigative judge has placed him under formal investigation for breach of trust, his attorney says.
Sarkozy is accused of taking advantage of an elderly L'Oreal heiress to fund a campaign.
