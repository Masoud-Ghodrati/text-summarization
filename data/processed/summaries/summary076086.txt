Basketball great Michael Jordan turns 50 on Sunday.
David Aldridge: Jordan was epitome of "that desire to win that mutated into obsession".
Jordan was the best player, most determined and toughest mentally, Aldridge says.
Aldridge: "His will was second to none. He took everyone on, and ultimately beat them".
