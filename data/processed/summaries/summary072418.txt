The Lebanese town of Arsal lies just across the border from war-torn Syria.
Since the Syrian conflict broke out, the flow of refugees has roughly tripled Arsal's population.
A million Syrian refugees are now registered with the U.N.'s refugee agency in Lebanon.
The U.N. says it has just $242M of the $1.89B it needs for the crisis in Lebanon alone.
