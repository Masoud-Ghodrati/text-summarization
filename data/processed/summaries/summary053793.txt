Fashion designer Tom Ford explains how his relationship with Yves Saint-Laurent deteriorated.
One letter accused Ford of destroying the French icon's 40-year career in 13 minutes.
Ford was creative director at Gucci when it bought Yves Saint-Laurent fashion house.
He has since started his own self-named label and moved into film, directing "A Single Man".
