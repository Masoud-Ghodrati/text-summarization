Bob Votruba has traveled nearly 60,000 miles across the U.S. to talk about kindness.
After the tragedy of the 2007 Virginia Tech shootings, he decided to change course.
He rides with his Boston terrier, Bogart, as company and sometimes bikes.
He gives himself reminders each day to be kind and gives assignments to others.
