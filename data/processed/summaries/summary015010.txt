Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is "grateful to President Obama," his lawyer says.
The Army is investigating the circumstances of his 2009 capture in Afghanistan.
Bergdahl was released after a U.S. deal with the Taliban in May.
The sergeant is back to work at the headquarters of a unit based in San Antonio.
