Aaron Miller: Debating what went wrong in Iraq not useful; protecting U.S. interests now is.
Iraq is complex, he says, with sectarian groups at odds, neighbors with own interests.
He says U.S. must work with Iraq's neighbors, even al-Assad, to halt ISIS. Democracy can wait.
Miller: U.S. must help right Iraqi military, but without combat forces. Point is to check terror.
