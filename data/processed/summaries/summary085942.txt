Shafilea Ahmed's parents are accused of killing the 17-year-old in an "honor murder".
They denied killing her, but on Monday, the mother said she saw her husband attack the girl.
Shafilea's sister testified last month that she saw her parents stuff a plastic bag into her mouth.
The United Nations estimates there could be 5,000 honor murders per year worldwide.
