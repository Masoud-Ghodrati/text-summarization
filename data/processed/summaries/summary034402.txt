Aafia Siddiqui is charged with shooting at U.S. officers while she was in Afghan custody.
She had bomb-making instructions, notes on attack in U.S., indictment says.
Siddiqui, a U.S.-educated neuroscientist, had been sought by F.B.I. for years.
She was extradited to U.S. from Afghanistan in 2008 to face trial.
