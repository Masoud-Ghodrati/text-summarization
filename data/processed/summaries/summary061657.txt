Defense attorneys move to block request for Aaron Hernandez's jailhouse calls.
The former NFL star is being held on first-degree murder charge in death of Odin Lloyd.
Prosecutor says Hernandez used "coded messages" while discussing killing during calls.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge stemming from the June killing.
