NEW: The death toll from the storm is now 95, a government agency says.
The storm has churned across the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
It has set off a landslide and blown away fragile houses, officials say.
The typhoon comes almost a year after a storm killed more than 1,200 people on Mindanao.
