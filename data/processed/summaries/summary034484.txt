Save the Chimps spent nearly a decade rehabilitating chimps from the Coulston Foundation.
The 266 chimps were used as medical research test subjects until 2002.
The animal welfare group recently transported the chimps to a sanctuary in Florida.
It's the first time these chimpanzees have lived outdoors.
