Catholic activists gathered in front of a Manhattan cathedral Tuesday.
They were protesting a Vatican reprimand of America's largest organization of Catholic nuns.
The church accused the organization of sponsoring "certain radical feminist themes".
Last week, crowds gathered in Cincinnati in a similar protest.
