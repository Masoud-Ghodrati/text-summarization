NEW: Between 6,000 and 8,000 people were killed in the massacre, the U.N. says.
The Bosnian town of Srebrenica was overrun by Serb forces in 1995.
It was later described as the worst atrocity on European soil since the Second World War.
The killings were carried out by ultra-nationalist forces bent on carving up Bosnia.
