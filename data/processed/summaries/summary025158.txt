Stephen Burt: National Poetry Month and onset of spring both great reasons to try poetry.
He says poets have long explored the warring emotion that change of season brings.
He says beauty, life, death collide. "It is spring! We are going to die," wrote Louise Gluck.
Burt: Poems help us express feeling. They are to be read, written, memorized. Try it!.
