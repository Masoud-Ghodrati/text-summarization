Despite saying he couldn't do it, Sam Mendes is returning for Bond 24.
The director previously said he couldn't helm the project due to theater commitments.
However, he announced Thursday that the studio is giving him time to honor those jobs, too.
Bond 24 is expected to arrive in the U.S. November 6, 2015.
