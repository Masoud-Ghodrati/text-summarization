NEW: Council reopens London Embassy; rebels report advances near B'ir al Ghanam.
14 members of the Transitional National Council's executive board are dismissed.
A TNC spokesman says the death of the rebels' military commander plays a role.
He says some who served on the board could be included in a new Cabinet.
