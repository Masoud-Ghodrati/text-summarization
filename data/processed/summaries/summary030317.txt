Iraq: Terrorist groups have control of about 40 kilos of uranium compounds.
U.S. officials say concern is minimal as the materials aren't enriched or weapons-grade.
The compounds were used by university departments in Mosul for study and research.
Iraqi ambassador asks U.N. for help "to stave off the threat of their use".
