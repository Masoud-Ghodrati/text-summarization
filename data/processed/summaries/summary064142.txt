Sextantio is a so-called "diffuse hotel" based in the Italian village of Santo Stefano di Sessanio.
Instead of being based under one roof, these hotels spread their facilities across different buildings in a village.
Sextantio uses barns, stables, pigsties and even an old brothel to create an upscale rural hotel.
