English FA decides that John Terry should not be England skipper ahead of his court case.
Terry faces charges of racially abusing an opponent while playing for Chelsea last year.
He will still be able to play for England at the Euro 2012 finals before the hearing begins.
Chelsea's manager says the 31-year-old defender will remain captain of the London club.
