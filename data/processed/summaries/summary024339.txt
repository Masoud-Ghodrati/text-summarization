Debra Davis was the girlfriend of "Whitey" Bulger's partner, Stephen "The Rifleman" Flemmi.
Flemmi testifies Bulger strangled 26-year-old Davis in 1981 because of what she knew.
She died after Flemmi told her about his and Bulger's link with a rogue FBI agent.
Flemmi: "I couldn't do it...(Bulger) knew it ... he said, 'I'll take care of it, I'll do it'".
