Italian anti-mob prosecutor says Pope faces threat from the mafia.
John Dickie says Francis represents serious threat to established criminal interests.
Mafias originated in 1860 but Pope didn't explicitly denounce the mafia until 1993.
Dickie says killing the Pope would be a "catastrophic own goal" for the mafias.
