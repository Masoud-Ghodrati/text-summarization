In jail interview with CNN, suspect Scott Roeder admits no guilt in Tiller slaying.
But Roeder says if he's convicted, "motive was the defense of the unborn".
Roeder is charged in death of Dr. George Tiller, who performed late-term abortions.
Family is shutting Tiller's clinic permanently, lawyer says.
