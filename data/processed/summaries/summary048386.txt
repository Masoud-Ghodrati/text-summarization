Florie Brizel is advocating for the creation of "Mobilology" as a new social science.
Mobilology aims to study how mobile devices are changing our society, and whether it is all for good.
Social changes created by mobile tech are "equivalent to the Industrial Revolution".
Students would learn about the effects of mobile and wireless use on human behavior.
