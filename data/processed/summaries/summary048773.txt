North American wireless carriers have deployed a new spam-reporting service.
Service generates a data feed of spam reports that carriers can integrate into security.
Organizations that disobey shortcode rules can find their shortcode lease revoked.
The service doesn't tell you if any action was taken against the spammer you reported.
