Hillary Clinton has key ties to four states: Illinois, Arkansas, New York and Pennsylvania.
Clinton herself has not publicly shied away from citizenship in any of these states.
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said Clinton "will forever be a Chicagoan at heart.".
Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania's governor elect, said her blood has "Pennsylvania values".
