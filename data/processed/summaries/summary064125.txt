Tim Stanley: If Sarah Palin were running, she would have the nomination in the bag by now.
He says she lacks problems like Gingrich's hubris, Romney's elitism, Santorum's extremism.
Stanley: Palin could rally male and female vote, young people, conservatives in large numbers.
It's too late, Stanley writes; the GOP will have to wait till 2016 to get its maverick.
