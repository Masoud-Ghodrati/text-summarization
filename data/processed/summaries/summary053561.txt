NEW: VA says some 600 people got letters in error due to a "coding error".
Letters sent last week informed 1,864 veterans and survivors of ALS diagnosis.
VA: "Employees are personally contacting" those who don't have disease.
Agency is reviewing notification process to ensure no such error is repeated.
