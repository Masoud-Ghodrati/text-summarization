Some passengers' flights were diverted, but their bags weren't, after the crash of Flight 214.
A prosecutor says a United employee and his fiance stole some of the piled-up bags.
The fiancee exchanged some of the bags' contents for $5,000 at Nordstrom, DA adds.
The 2 are charged on three felony counts apiece; they're both free on bail.
