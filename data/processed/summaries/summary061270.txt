Merrill Newman, 85, was detained by North Korean authorities on October 26, his son says.
Newman, a Korean War veteran, was wrapping up a 10-day tour of the country.
The day before he was due to leave, he was questioned by North Korean authorities.
He had "all necessary and valid travel documents to take his tour," agency says.
