A popular Chinese dictionary has left out the "gay" definition of a word used to describe homosexuals.
The term "tongzhi" traditionally means comrade but has evolved to refer to gay men and lesbians.
Compilers of the dictionary said they didn't want to encourage that use of the word.
Activists and linguists are angered at the omission saying it's not right to leave out a widely-used word.
