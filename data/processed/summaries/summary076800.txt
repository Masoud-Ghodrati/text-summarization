Bob Greene: At New Year, consider those, like Cardinals' La Russa, who quit while ahead.
He asks: How many of us could make a resolution like that? How many could not look back?.
He says Beatles, Rocky Marciano did. Michael Jordan tried, but came back to what he loved.
Greene: Somewhere someone at top of field is mulling quitting in 2012. it's harder than it looks.
