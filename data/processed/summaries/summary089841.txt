House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi calls for an ethics probe into Rep. Anthony Weiner's behavior.
He admits to having inappropriate relationships with women and lying about it.
Other Democrats have said they welcome such a probe, as does Weiner.
But a Republican calls Pelosi's move "hollow," saying she should have told him to resign.
