Linda Bazzi's husband discovers a fire in their home in the middle of the night.
A surveillance camera shows an individual throwing a firebomb into front window.
She, her husband and their children are safe but their house is charred.
"I'm scared. I'm really scared for my life right now," Bazzi tells CNN affiliate WDIV.
