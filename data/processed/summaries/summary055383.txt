Syrian children in refugee camps in Lebanon lack basics to get through harsh winters.
Hala Habib Qiblawi organized a Facebook campaign to get rain boots for children.
Within 24 hours she had thousands of pairs of boots, and more keep arriving.
"There is still humanity on earth, especially in this part of the world," Qiblawi says.
