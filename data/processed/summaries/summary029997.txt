Mutations in the tumor-suppressing gene BRCA1 can increase the risk of cancer.
Harmful BRCA mutations can increase a woman's risk for breast cancer five times.
A test can help detect mutations, but can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.
Most women with breast or ovarian cancers don't have a BRCA mutation.
