Max Clifford is found guilty of indecent assaults on teenage girls.
He was convicted after allegations against TV presenter Jimmy Savile were investigated.
He was convicted of eight assaults, cleared of two; jury didn't reach verdict on 11th case.
Clifford, who denies the claims, has called his arrest and prosecution "a nightmare".
