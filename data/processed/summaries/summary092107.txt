29 cases of Legionnaires' disease have been diagnosed at Pittsburgh VA since January 2011.
At least 5 of the cases were acquired from the hospital.
Relatives of two veterans who died after contracting the disease blame the VA.
Records indicate the hospital's water systems were not properly maintained.
