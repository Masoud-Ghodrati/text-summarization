Two Michigan brothers are granted a new trial after 25 years.
New testimony from a purported witness was uncovered through Facebook, officials say.
The new testimony led a judge to throw out convictions, according to officials.
Raymond and Thomas Highers, both 46, were sentenced to life in prison for a 1987 murder.
