San Francisco's Exploratorium reopens Wednesday in a $300 million new home.
The interactive science museum, on the city's Pier 15, has 600 exhibits.
The museum has a grownup feel that makes it as much fun for adults as for kids.
Even the building itself is a giant science experiment, with sensors all around.
