Rowena Webster is chief goalscorer for Australia's women's water polo team.
The 25-year-old has made over 150 international appearances for her country.
Webster was part of the team that won bronze at the London 2012 Olympics.
She says the sport can be rough under the water as players jostle for the ball.
