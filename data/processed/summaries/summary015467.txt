A wildfire that began April 28 is still raging in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
Some 268,000 of the park's 402,000 acres have burned and there's no clear end in sight.
All entrances to the refuge have been closed indefinitely, a fire spokesman says.
The official says it will likely take a major weather event, like a hurricane, to douse the fire.
