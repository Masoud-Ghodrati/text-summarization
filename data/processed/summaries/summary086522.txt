Mark Roth is a scientist who is studying ways to put life into suspended animation.
In a TED Talk, he describes how his lab has put some organisms into a suspended state.
The animals are revived and appear to suffer no lasting damage, he says.
Such techniques may one day keep people from dying so they can get urgent care, he says.
