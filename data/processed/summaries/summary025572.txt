Marin Cilic is free to play in next week's Paris Masters after his drug suspension was reduced.
His nine-month ban was trimmed to four months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The former top-10 player was listed as testing positive for banned substance nikethamide.
The court's decision goes against the ITF, which sought a ban longer than nine months.
