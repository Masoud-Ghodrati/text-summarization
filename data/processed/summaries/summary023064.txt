Katherine Jackson's testimony will be followed by defense from AEG Live lawyers.
CNN obtained video clips from the deposition of a former Jackson tour doctor.
"I think we're going to have a problem," Dr. Stuart Finkelstein said he told Paul Gongaware.
AEG Live exec Gongaware denied Finkelstein told him about Jackson's drug use.
