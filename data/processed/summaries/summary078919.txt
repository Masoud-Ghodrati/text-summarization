Alaskan John Baker wins this year's Iditarod Sled Dog Race in record time.
His win marks the first time an Alaskan Inupiaq has taken top prize.
The Inupiaq are an Eskimo group that still relies on a traditional, subsistence lifestyle.
A crowd at the finish line in Nome erupted in cheers and native chants as Baker won.
