Last weekend a large piece of "space junk" tumbled to earth.
Meg Urry, an astronomer, says it was the remains of a valuable research satellite.
The satellite's X-ray images of the sky enabled views of high-energy phenomena.
Urry: Thousands of astronomers used the ROSAT satellite to study the universe.
