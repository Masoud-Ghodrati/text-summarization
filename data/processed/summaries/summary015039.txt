U.S. immigration officials receive eight calls in the week after U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Those eight calls come from local Arizona police checking a person's immigration status.
The high court upheld part of an Arizona law that allows for illegal immigration checks.
The eight calls are "a normal volume" and resulted in 38 arrests, officials say.
