Menachem Bodner, born Eli Gottesman, survived Auschwitz as a child and was later adopted.
Now aged 73, he is trying to trace his twin, Jeno, who he last saw at the concentration camp.
He hopes social media, including Facebook, will help him find his long-lost brother.
The pair, originally from Ukraine, have "matching" camp ID tattoos: A 7733 and A 7734.
