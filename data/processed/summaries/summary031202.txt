Dr. Katherine Mitchell says injured war veterans can wait up to 10 months to be seen.
"We're talking about people that were injured by being blown up by IEDs," she says.
Mitchell says she reported alleged practice to the VA's Office of Inspector General.
The VA did not directly comment, referring CNN to Eric Shinseki's Senate testimony.
