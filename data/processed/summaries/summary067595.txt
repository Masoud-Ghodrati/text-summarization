India is retaliating against the U.S. over treatment of consular official who was strip-searched.
Ruben Navarrette: The official was not a threat to safety and the charges are murky.
He says the Marshals Service may have overreacted and created a diplomatic furor.
Navarrette: U.S. relationship with India is vital and shouldn't be lightly endangered.
