Free Skype for the iPhone will be available from the iTunes App Store Tuesday.
Calls on Skype for iPhone work only if you're in range of a Wi-Fi network.
The feature includes the ability to accept incoming conference calls.
Skype was scheduled to announce the iPhone app Monday at the CTIA trade show.
