David J. Renz is accused of killing a librarian and raping her 10-year-old daughter.
He abducted the pair as they left a gymnastics class in upstate New York, police say.
Authorities say he managed to take off an electronic tracking device before the attack.
Probation office was not alerted because he reconnected the anklet so fast, officer says.
