NEW: Four policemen are charged with a cover-up and face trial Friday.
Gu Kailai and a family aide are accused of murdering a British businessman.
The defendants don't object to the prosecution's charges, a court official says.
Gu's husband, Bo Xilai, is a former top official who has been stripped of his posts.
