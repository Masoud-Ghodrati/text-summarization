John Avlon says a Senate hearing on reforming Congress was a positive step.
He says members of Congress shouldn't be paid until they can pass a budget.
The Senate should have to vote presidential appointees up or down in 90 days, he says.
Avlon: The old practice of a filibuster requiring continuous talk should be brought back.
