Justin Ross Harris' toddler son died, left in a hot car while Harris went to work.
Sunny Hostin left her baby in a car on a hot day, but quickly realized it and ran back.
Children die every year from being left in hot cars by mistake; 44 died in 2013.
Hostin: If it was a mistake, Harris should not face charges. Anguish will be punishment.
