Webb Simpson says his hands and legs were shaking during U.S. Open final round.
The American finished one over par to win his first major title at Olympic Club.
He is the 15th different major winner in a row, and the third consecutive American.
Simpson may miss the British Open due to the imminent birth of his second child.
