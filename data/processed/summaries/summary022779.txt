Iraq vet Darren Manzella was discharged under "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
Manzella had told his supervisor about harassing calls, e-mails years earlier.
The sergeant served a second tour in Iraq while his unit knew he was gay.
Discharge came after a network TV interview as gay serviceman in combat zone.
