A Facebook page is set up to help locate missing graduate Will Norton.
He was one of about 450 seniors to graduate from Joplin High School Sunday.
The high school principal says the school looks like "it's been bombed from the outside in".
Joplin's public school district has canceled classes for the rest of the year.
