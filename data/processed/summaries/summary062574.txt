Fresh details have been revealed over alleged fixing by New Zealand cricket players.
Testimony by two players to the ICC alleges an international great encouraged them to fix.
Chris Cairns says he was the player referred to, but denies the allegations.
Cairns has successfully challenged match-fixing allegations in the courts in the past.
