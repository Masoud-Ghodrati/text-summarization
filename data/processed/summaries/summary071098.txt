Alwin Landry's supply vessel was alongside Deepwater Horizon at time of blast.
Landry said first sign of trouble was when drilling "mud" began falling onto his ship.
Captain radioed rig's bridge and was warned he should move his ship away.
Rig sank April 22, two days after explosion; 11 presumed dead; oil still gushing into Gulf.
