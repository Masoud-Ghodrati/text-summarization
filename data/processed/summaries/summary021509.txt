Vatican announces the formation of St Peter's Cricket Club.
The club hopes to field a team against the Church of England and other sides next year.
Cricket "is something that covers many, many religions and ethnic groups," says Australian envoy.
The side will play in the yellow and white Vatican colors, with the keys of St Peter as emblem.
