King Juan Carlos is readmitted to a hospital in Madrid for surgery on his hip.
The 74-year-old monarch injured his hip in a fall while on a private hunting trip in Africa.
The trip has caused controversy because of its cost and because it included elephant hunting.
The king had hip replacement surgery earlier this month.
