The Turkish foreign minister meets in Syria with Hamas leader Meshaal.
Davutoglu also met with Syria's president and Lebanese prime minister.
Israeli-Turkish relations soured in 2006 after Meshaal made an official visit to Turkey.
Their ties were further strained when Israel raided a Turkish aid flotilla to Gaza.
