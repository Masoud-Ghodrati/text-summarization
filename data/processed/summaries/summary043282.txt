Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, is the focus of a massive international manhunt.
A warrant notes that police want him arrested on 5 charges, including murder.
He caused "Stephen Harper and (lawmakers) to reasonably fear for their safety," it says.
Police say Magnotta killed and dismembered a Chinese student, then mailed body parts.
