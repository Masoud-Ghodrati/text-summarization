Actress in "Innocence of Muslims" filed complaint alleging she was a victim of fraud.
She'd sued the filmmaker and YouTube's parent company, saying she had been harmed.
A judge denies her request that YouTube be ordered to take the video down from its site.
The trailer for the film has stirred protests by Muslims worldwide.
