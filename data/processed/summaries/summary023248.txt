Amy Bass: Brazil trashed by Germany at World Cup, but it was more: It was historic.
She says Germany's rout, with fast, furious scoring, denied Brazil its sure-thing victory.
She says excuses can be made, but Germany was great; Brazil coach wisely said "life goes on".
Bass: Brazil fans gave splendid display of "beautiful game" by standing in tribute to Germany.
