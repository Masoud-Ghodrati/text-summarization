Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up gym mat at his Georgia high school.
Authorities ruled his death accidental, said he didn't have "significant injuries" before dying.
The family questioned the ruling, ordering an autopsy that found "non-accidental ... trauma".
U.S. Justice Department doesn't find "sufficient indication of a civil rights violation".
