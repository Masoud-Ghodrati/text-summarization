Nadim Shehadi says the Beirut attack would be a useful moment to evaluate U.S. regional policy.
History 'shows pattern where Lebanon is like a hostage, the West the subject of extortion'.
Shehadi: Lebanese, Syrians are worried over whether al-Assad's 'blackmail' still works.
Shehadi: Little will from U.S. presidential candidates to make decisive move against regime.
