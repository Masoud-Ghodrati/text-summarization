NEW: Breivik called police from the shooting scene but they were unable to call him back.
Anders Breivik must stay in isolation in case he tampers with evidence, judge says.
Breivik says isolation is "boring, monotonous and a sadistic method of torture".
He is accused of carrying out twin attacks a month ago that killed 77.
