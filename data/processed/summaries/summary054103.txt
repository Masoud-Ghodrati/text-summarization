Abu-Bakr Baghdadi was purportedly filmed giving a sermon at a mosque in northern Iraq last week.
Observers claimed on social media that the Arab warlord was wearing an expensive Western watch.
Others now claim he is wearing an "Islamic watch" that sets prayer reminders and has a Quran bookmark function.
An employee at Al-Fajr, the Saudi-based watchmaker, tells CNN that al-Baghdadi's watch "appears to be one of ours".
