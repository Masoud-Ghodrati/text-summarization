South Korea holds a regular artillery drill on islands where tensions have flared before.
North Korea describes the exercise as a provocation.
In 2010, the North responded to a drill in the same area by shelling a South Korean island.
More military exercises by South Korea and the U.S. are scheduled for the coming weeks.
