23 students from a Goa state school treated for food poisoning, police say.
23 students died and 25 people were hospitalized in Bihar state earlier this week.
The deaths in Bihar have prompted a focus on food safety.
Authorities think the poison in the Bihar case was a chemical used in agriculture.
