Homeowner sets trap, and a 17-year-old from Germany is killed.
Ruben Navarrette says the homeowner deserves prosecution for his actions.
He says it was wrong for the youth to be in the house, but that doesn't excuse shooter.
Navarrette: Slain youth's father is wrong to blame America for "cowboy" culture.
