Zimmerman defense attorney Don West used a knock-kock joke in his opening statement.
A photo posted by one of his daughters shows dad and daughters eating ice cream.
A comment with the photo said "We beat stupidity celebration cones," and "#dadkilledit".
West: "Sometimes we're deeply disappointed by the things our children do".
