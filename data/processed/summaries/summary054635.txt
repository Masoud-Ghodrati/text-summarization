Michael Nodianos "sincerely regrets his behavior and his comments," his lawyer says.
Nodianos appeared on a video mocking a girl at the center of a rape case.
He has been interviewed by police and had "no involvement" in the incident, lawyer says.
Two 16-year-olds have been charged with sexually assaulting the girl.
