This year was bittersweet for Rafael Nadal, who won another major but suffered more injuries.
Nadal sustained back and wrist injuries before undergoing appendix surgery in November.
The 14-time grand slam winner says he is hoping to be healthy for the start of the 2015 season.
Nadal is putting an emphasis on the Australian Open, the year's first major that starts next month.
