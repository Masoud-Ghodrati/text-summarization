#BringBackOurGirls was a social media response to the April 14 kidnapping of 276 Nigerian girls.
The cries of worried families inspired people worldwide to participate in the campaign.
Alasholuyi Kehinde from Lagos, Nigeria, kept up the campaign as its popularity faded.
He demanded the release of the Chibok girls every day for more than 180 days.
