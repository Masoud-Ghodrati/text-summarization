Film critic Agnes Poirier: The Cannes Film Festival is the Olympics of cinema.
It was created as a reaction against Italian dictator Mussolini promoting fascist-Italian films.
Poirier: At Cannes directors are free to throw tantrums and tell critics what they really think.
Today success at Cannes is the Nobel Prize directors and actors secretly covet, says Poirier.
