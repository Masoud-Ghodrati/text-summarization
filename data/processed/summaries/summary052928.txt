Palestinian activists set up a protest village in an area slated for Israeli settlement.
Israeli authorities ordered them to leave; police executed that order early Sunday.
More than 60 activists were taken into custody, then later released, police say.
Critical Palestinian leaders say the settlements would cut the West Bank in two.
