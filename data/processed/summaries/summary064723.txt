#NotABugSplat project set up to humanize victims of drone warfare in Pakistan.
The project uses a giant photograph of a girl who lost her family in a strike.
Drone strikes have drawn heated opposition in Pakistan because of civilian casualties.
Thousands of people, including women and children, have died since 2004.
