NEW: A Beebe resident recalls last year as "freaky," with "dead birds lying everywhere".
About 200 blackbirds die this year in the city after two spurts of fireworks, an official says.
"Someone went into the roost and set off fireworks," she adds.
About 5,000 birds were found dead in the Arkansas city last New Year's Eve.
