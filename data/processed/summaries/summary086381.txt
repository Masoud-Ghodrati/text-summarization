Military trial of the alleged planners of the 9/11 attacks on America began on Saturday.
Douglass Cassel: Trying them in a U.S. military commission will not be seen as credible.
He asks, why not try them before the same civilian courts that try homegrown terrorists?.
Cassel: The decision to use a military trial was made for reasons of politics, not justice.
