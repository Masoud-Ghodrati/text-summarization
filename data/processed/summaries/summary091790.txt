NEW: Martial law invoked to impose peace on the region after unrest.
Measure follows killings of 57 people last week in province of Maguindanao.
Security forces search the home of Andal Ampatuan Jr., mayor of Datu Unsay.
Authorities say Ampatuan Jr. directed the November 23 politically motivated killings.
