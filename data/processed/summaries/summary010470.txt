AEG Live CEO Randy Phillip is testifying in the Jackson wrongful death trial.
Feisty chemistry between Jacksons' lawyer and Phillips should keep jurors attention.
AEG lawyers advised him not to review old e-mails before testimony, exec says.
The Jacksons accuse AEG Live of negligently hiring Dr. Conrad Murray.
