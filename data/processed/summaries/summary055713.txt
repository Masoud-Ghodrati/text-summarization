Indonesian migrant worker Riyanti helped abused compatriot Erwiana at airport.
In pain and with blackened skin, Erwiana said her condition was due to a skin allergy.
Erwiana's case is at the center of an investigation and protests by thousands of people.
A rights group want a law that requires migrant workers to live with their employers to be scrapped.
