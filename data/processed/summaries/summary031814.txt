Inspectors will visit Iran's Arak heavy-water production plant next month, IAEA says.
Iran has agreed to freeze work at the Arak site under an interim deal with world powers.
The heavy-water reactor could be used as a source of plutonium.
Iran agreed on a framework for increased cooperation with the IAEA this month.
