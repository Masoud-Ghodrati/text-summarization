NEW: Anti-nuclear activists warn of a potential environmental catastrophe.
The San Onofre nuclear plant has been shut down since radioactive gas escaped.
Officials have said there's no harm to the public health, but can't identify problem's cause.
The head of the NRC says the plant won't restart until a cause and plan is put forward.
