Last week, Washington's governor said 1 tank at the Hanford nuclear site was leaking.
He now says 6 tanks are leaking radioactive waste, calling the news "disturbing".
The leaks pose "no immediate health risks," but do pose concerns, the governor says.
Hanford site is home to one of the world's largest nuclear cleanup efforts.
