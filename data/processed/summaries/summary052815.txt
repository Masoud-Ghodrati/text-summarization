Joan Teno asks: Why do doctors continue to test and treat patients who are clearly dying?.
She says instead they should be helping very sick patients weigh quality of life against quantity.
Teno: Hospice care doubles, but patients still in ICU until last 3 days of life. Do they want this?.
Teno: Intervention lucrative for medical industry; this wars with patient-centered end-of-life care.
