Campaigns and supporters of President Obama, Mitt Romney trade caustic barbs.
The White House calls a Republican ad on welfare changes "blatantly dishonest".
The Romney campaign calls an Obama super-PAC ad "discredited and dishonest".
With the election less than three months away, both sides are buying more ad time.
