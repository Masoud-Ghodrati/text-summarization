The second suspect, named by British media as comedian Freddie Starr, is quizzed again.
The suspect is in his 60s and from Warwickshire, British police say.
Starr denied any allegations against him in media interviews last month.
A TV documentary has detailed allegations of sex abuse against TV host Jimmy Savile.
