Employer penalty for not providing full health care delayed for a year, till 2015..
Aaron Carroll: Outcry oversized since penalty applies only to companies with 50-plus workers.
Employer penalty will likely apply to about 10,000 companies out of about 6 million, he says.
Carroll: It's all political theater -- Obamacare would hurt without penalty, but it would function.
