A clash between Tibetan protesters and Chinese police leaves at least one person dead.
China's official news agency and Tibetan rights groups offer conflicting versions of events.
A Chinese government official accuses the rights groups of trying to "distort the truth".
The clash comes after a string of self-immolations by Tibetan protesters in recent months.
