Carol Anne Bond is challenging her conviction on a federal chemical weapon charge.
She used poisons to try to get back at a woman who had an affair with Bond's husband.
She received a measure of support from the Supreme Court during oral arguments Tuesday.
The case touches on the conflict between federal and state powers in the 10th Amendment.
