Howell Raines: Romney's Mormonism was under-the-radar issue in Tuesday's primaries.
He says Ala. governor's backing "most conservative" Santorum was code for religious ally.
He says in 1980 Christians unified with Catholics over Ronald Reagan, creating a base.
Raines: Romney's Mormomism less hurtful in run against Obama; South will still go GOP.
