Mike Downey: Tony Gwynn had dazzling baseball, but he kept his humility, common touch.
He says in 9,288 official at-bats, he struck out 434 times. You threw it, Gwynn hit it.
But he had something more, he says.  He seemed eternally happy, sociable, without airs.
Downey: He took obvious joy in the game and the trappings. Baseball mourns his loss.
