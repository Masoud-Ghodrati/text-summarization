A convoy of protesters reaches Islamabad Monday night after a long march.
The rally in the "blue zone" protests the current political system.
The demonstrators are led by a Muslim cleric who recently returned to Pakistan.
He says he wants to clean up politics, but the government says his demands are illegal.
