Yasin Bhatkal is arrested near the border with Nepal, authorities say.
He is wanted in relation to a series of deadly bombings in India.
Bhatkal is believed to be a co-founder of the Indian Mujahideen, a banned militant group.
The United States says the group's bomb attacks have killed hundreds of civilians.
