Sixty-five years after D-Day, CNN correspondent's uncle talks about experience.
Lenny Lisovicz describes day he and his unit stormed Omaha Beach.
He says the Nazis "had you pinpointed. It was just like shootin' ducks on a pond".
Lisovicz was one of 22, out of 220 men in his group, to return home alive.
