A decorated U.S. Army soldier allegedly admits killing a 4-month-old baby girl.
Pfc. Jeffrey Sliker was charged in the death of Laurne Clark, also known as Mollie Sliker.
An autopsy revealed blunt force trauma to the skull as the cause of death.
The suspect's brother says he can't believe Sliker was responsible for the death.
