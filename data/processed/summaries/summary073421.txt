New York St. Patrick's Day parade organizers said that they will allow first ever LGBT group to march in 2015.
The change ends longstanding ban that drew national criticism and corporate boycotts.
Last March, Mayor Bill de Blasio declined to march, and Guinness and Heineken pulled out as sponsors.
GLAAD president: "I'm cautiously optimistic that this is definitely an important and historic step ...".
