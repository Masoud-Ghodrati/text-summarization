GSA is under a congressional investigation for wasteful spending.
The spending came to light after a report detailed an $823,000 conference in 2010.
CNN has found the agency also spent more than $20,000 on cooking classes.
The GSA says its new chief 'has instituted stringent new policies ... to put an end to this misuse of taxpayer dollars'.
