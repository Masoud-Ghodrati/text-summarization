Class-action suit brought by Adriana Leon requires ICE to change policy on home raids.
Agents had stormed into Latino homes in middle of night, pulling people out of bed.
Leon: ICE agents terrified families and did not have permission or warrants.
Leon: ICE must be held to the same legal standards as everyone else to avoid abuses.
