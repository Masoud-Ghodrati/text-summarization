The ACLU says three immigrant women were sexually assaulted in ICE custody.
A class-action lawsuit has been filed on their behalf, the ACLU says.
"We believe these complaints are just the tip of the iceberg," an ACLU lawyer says.
ICE says all abuse allegations are investigated and the agency has a "zero tolerance" policy.
