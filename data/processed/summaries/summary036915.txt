Amelia Rose Earhart will try to complete the same global circumnavigation Amelia Mary Earhart attempted 77 years ago.
The trip will take about two and a half weeks, covering 14 countries.
Earhart hopes to become youngest woman to circumnavigate the world in a single-engine aircraft.
Earhart isn't related to her famous namesake ... though for 30 years she thought she was.
