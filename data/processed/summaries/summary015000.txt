Teddy Roosevelt addressed Progressive Party 100 years ago as their candidate.
John Avlon says the issues he championed were ahead of their time, many still relevant today.
Roosevelt lost the election but gained the highest third-party vote in U.S. history.
Avlon: Roosevelt's "vigorous citizenship and heroic sense of politics still inspire".
