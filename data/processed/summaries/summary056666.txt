Salaam Somali Bank has installed an ATM in the Somali capital Mogadishu.
The machine dispenses U.S. dollars rather than the official currency, the Somali shilling.
The new machine follows the installation of ATMs in the northern city of Hargeisa in the breakaway Somaliland region.
Remittance income makes up more than half of Somalia's gross national income.
