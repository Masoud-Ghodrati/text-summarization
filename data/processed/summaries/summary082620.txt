John Avlon: 80 U.S. CEOs signed letter seeking balanced, partisan plan to tame debt.
He says Mitt Romney has refused to consider a plan that includes revenue increases.
Avlon says the $16 trillion debt is too big to be tackled through spending cuts alone.
He says CEOs want something like Bowles-Simpson plan, and Obama is closer to it.
