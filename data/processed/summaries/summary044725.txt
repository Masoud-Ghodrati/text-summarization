Anders Behring Breivik will remain in Norwegian custody until April, a court rules.
The fact he may be confined to a mental health facility is reason to keep him locked up.
Psychiatrists had deemed Breivik psychotic, though a second opinion was ordered.
He is accused of killing 77 people in July in a bomb attack and shooting rampage.
