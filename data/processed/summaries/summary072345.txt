Judge: Army Corps of Engineers liable for catastrophic flooding during Katrina.
New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin says ruling may "open up the floodgates" for more suits.
Nagin calls decision "a surprise," says he expects feds to appeal.
Plaintiffs awarded damages from Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish.
