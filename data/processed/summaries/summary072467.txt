A Coast Guardsman dies after a panga boat rams his boat, authorities say.
The panga flees, but it is eventually intercepted and its 2 occupants detained.
The 2 Mexicans are charged with killing a U.S. officer and held without bond.
They told investigators they were transporting gas to another panga boat.
