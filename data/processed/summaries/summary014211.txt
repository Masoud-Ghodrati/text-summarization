Welsh golfer Stuart Manley hits a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne.
Manley celebrates wildly as he thinks he has won a new Mercedes.
But the car only goes to those who hit a hole in one in the fourth and final round.
A disappointed Manley then hits an 11 on the par-4 fourth and finishes with a 72.
