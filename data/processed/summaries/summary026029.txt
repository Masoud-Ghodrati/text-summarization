In 2002, Cuban pitcher Jose Ariel Contreras defected, signed with Yankees for $32 million.
He ran the risk of never seeing Cuba again, as the government considered him a traitor.
But Cuba is lifting some restrictions on those who want to travel abroad and return.
Contreras, the first sports star to test the new law, returns for a visit after "years of pain".
