Michaela Harte-McAreavey, 27, was strangled in January 2011 just days after her wedding.
Officers believe she was killed after interrupting a burglary as she returned to her hotel room.
Two hotel workers pleaded not guilty to premeditated killing, police say.
Proceedings were adjourned after a jury of six men and three women was selected.
