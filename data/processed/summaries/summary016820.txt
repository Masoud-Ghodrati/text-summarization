Muslim Brotherhood has been part of the political scene in Egypt for more than 80 years.
It advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran.
The Brotherhood is the oldest and largest opposition group in Egypt.
Its offshoots outside Egypt are markedly more conservative in their views.
