15-year-old Abigail Hernandez was last seen walking home from school on October 9.
Officials fear she may be held against her will.
Authorities said Friday a letter to her mother purportedly from the girl appears genuine.
"We believe in fact that it was written by Abby," says a New Hampshire official.
