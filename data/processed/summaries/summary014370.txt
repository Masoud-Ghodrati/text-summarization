Police lost keys to Wembley Stadium -- home of the Olympic football finals -- last week.
Team of detectives sent to search the arena, but found no trace of the missing set.
All internal locks inside the 90,000-seat stadium have been changed as a precaution.
Cost of replacing high-tech laser keys expected to run into tens of thousands of dollars.
