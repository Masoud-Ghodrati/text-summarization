Joan E. Darrah says she lived two lives in the Navy, wondering if each day was the last.
Darrah says she pretended her partner didn't exist, that she was straight, avoided people.
She says a close brush with death on 9/11 caused her to reassess life under policy.
Darrah: "I know we can do better than 'don't ask, don't tell' ".
