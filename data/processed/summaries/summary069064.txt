Former Australian batsman John Dyson sacked as coach of the West Indies.
Dyson, the former Sri Lankan coach, took charge of the West Indies in 2007.
He was due to take them to next month's Champions Trophy in South Africa.
The West Indies Cricket Board offered no reason for Dyson's sudden dismissal.
