Syrian Justice Ministry says photos are "fake" and have no relation to government detainees.
It also says pictures show "foreign terrorists" and regime supporters killed by terrorists.
The photos of alleged mass torture and killing in Syria come as peace talks are to begin.
Report authors say they show "systematic torture and killing" of prisoners by al-Assad regime.
