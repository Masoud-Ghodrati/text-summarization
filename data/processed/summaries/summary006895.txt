NATO spokeswoman says the alliance is not specifically targeting Gadhafi.
U.N. resolution applies to Gadhafi in his capacity as head of military, official says.
NATO last weekend employed helicopters against Gadhafi's military assets.
Bombing began March 31 under a U.N. mandate to protect civilians during the fighting.
