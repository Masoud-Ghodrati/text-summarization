Jessica Colotl, an undocumented immigrant, was arrested, detained after traffic violation.
In U.S. since she was 11, she is close to graduation from her university in Georgia.
"I'm just trying to live the American dream and finish my education," says Colotl.
Advocates and lawyers for Colotl liken case to "witch hunt" and say system is flawed.
