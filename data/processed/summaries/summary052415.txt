Kyle was fatally shot at a Texas gun range by a former Marine Saturday, police say.
"I'm a better husband and father than I was a killer," he told a Time interviewer.
He wrote "American Sniper," which describes his time in Iraq, where he killed 160.
"Despite what your momma told you, Violence does solve problems," Kyle's company motto says.
