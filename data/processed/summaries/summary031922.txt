John Dodson, an ATF agent, wants to write an insider's account of the U.S. operation.
ACLU said forbidding the book's publication violated Dodson's First Amendment rights.
Agencies will review his manuscript, make redactions, law enforcement official says.
Earlier, the government said it was blocking publication for morale, ethics reasons.
