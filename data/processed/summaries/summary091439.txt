NEW: Clinton, Mullen say U.S., Pakistan must continue working together.
Clinton will lay out in a "no-kidding" way what the U.S. expects, says one official.
The secretary will warn that U.S. aid is in jeopardy unless Pakistan makes progress.
Clinton said recently that a strong U.S.-Pakistan relationship "is in our national interests".
