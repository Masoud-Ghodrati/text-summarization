Elderly residents in Ishinomaki are struggling to adapt to post-tsunami surroundings.
Some live in temporary homes, 18 months after the earthquake and tsunami.
One resident fears that another change in government will delay reconstruction work.
Another says: "The government hasn't done a thing for us. They've only cleared the debris".
