Jim Carrey addresses Class of 2014 at the Maharishi University of Management.
Carrey said his father could have become a comic but chose the safe route as an accountant.
He tells students "you might as well take a chance on doing what you love".
He jokes about meditation as time "to slack off twice a day for an hour and a half".
