Texas-born architect Barry Hughes picks the Flame Towers in Baku as his favorite building.
Building towers was a challenge says Hughes and had to be weighted to withstand earthquakes.
Hughes wishes he had designed Notre Dame du Haut, a concrete Catholic chapel in Ronchamp, France.
Designed by Swiss-born architect Le Corbusier, the modernist building was completed in 1954.
