Ayatollah Ali Khamenei tries to stop annual event celebrating the last days of winter.
He urges Iranians to avoid ancient practice of fire jumping, feasting on Chaharshanbe Soori.
He says festivities have no basis in Islam and can cause "harm and corruption".
Iran is beefing up security to ensure "order and calm" during the two-week festivities.
