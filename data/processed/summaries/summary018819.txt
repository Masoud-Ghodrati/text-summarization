A North Korean-flagged tanker enters a rebel-held oil port in eastern Libya.
Prime minister: It "will be bombed" if the ship's captain doesn't follow orders.
The captain allegedly said militia on board the vessel didn't let him leave the port.
Libya hasn't been able to profit from its immense oil resources due to instability.
