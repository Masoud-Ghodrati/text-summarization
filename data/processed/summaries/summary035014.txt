Michael Brown's stepfather says he's sorry for yelling "Burn this bitch down" last week.
Police are investigating whether Louis Head intended to incite riot, police chief says.
Don't expect Head to be prosecuted because it's tough to prove, law enforcement says.
"We just wish he would just shut up," law enforcement official says of Ferguson police chief.
