Ira Shapiro says Senate is much more divisive place because of Mitch McConnell.
He argues that the traditions of the Senate have been about "mutual trust and respect".
The Republican Minority Leader has, says Shapiro, taken the Senate to a new low.
McConnell won GOP primary for his Senate seat, will face Democrat Alison Grimes.
