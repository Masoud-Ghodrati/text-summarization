Psychologist: Age 7 is when to discuss tough things like bin Laden's death.
Ask younger kids leading questions to find out if they've heard talk about it.
Keep discussions simple and reassuring; bin Laden was bad and was punished.
Above all, emphasize that the grown-ups are in charge and that kids are safe.
