These little sea creatures are called "by-the-wind sailors"; the scientific name is Velella velella.
The palm-sized creatures have a clear, distinctive fin sticking up from a blue, oval body.
They first started showing up in Washington and Oregon.
They are now being spotted on beaches north of Los Angeles.
