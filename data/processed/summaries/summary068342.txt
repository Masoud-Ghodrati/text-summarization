Militants were seen moving hostages "chained and covered with blankets" into pickups.
They were driven to a cave, a website associated with Yemen's Defense Ministry says.
The mission, launched 4 miles from the cave, killed all 7 kidnappers, Yemen says.
But former hostages say five other captives were moved before rescuers arrived.
