Officials earlier said track circuit had been repaired June 17, five days before crash.
In update, NTSB says that after repair, circuit periodically lost "ability to detect trains".
It's not clear if operators were aware of problem before accident, NTSB says.
Since crash, trains have been operated manually, NTSB has run tests at crash site.
