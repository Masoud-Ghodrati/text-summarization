Bob Greene says he met Bob Orsa in 2008 in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.
He says Orsa was opening a restaurant just as the economy was tanking ; he's still hopeful.
He says customers feel pinch; it affects business, but unlike banks no one bails him out.
Greene: Orsa has hung on, employing 13 people, determined to succeed in his community.
