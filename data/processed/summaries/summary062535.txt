Exhibit "In the Playroom" depicts young children re-enacting violent events.
Photographer Jonathan Hobin says it reflects on modern events that affect children.
He says the exhibit is supposed to prompt dialogue about "issues in our world".
The photos have drawn criticism from those who say it crosses an ethical line.
