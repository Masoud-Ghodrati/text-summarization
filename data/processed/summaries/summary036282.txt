Colin Powell says U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of "Curveball".
Curveball was an Iraqi defector whose claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction have been discredited.
Curveball's claims helped bolster the Bush administration's case for going to war in Iraq.
Curveball now admits he lied, but says he doesn't regret his actions.
