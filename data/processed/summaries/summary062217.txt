The partner of a man on board MH370 describes a feeling of limbo.
"Nine months, none of us are as strong as we used to be," the wife of another MH370 passenger says.
She says it's vital for AirAsia 8501 relatives to lean on friends and family for support.
Search for MH370 continues in Indian Ocean, but could be months before anything found.
