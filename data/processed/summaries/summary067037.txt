Jim Foley's mother says the U.S. must find a way to negotiate with terrorists.
She criticizes the U.S. government over its actions since son's 2012 disappearance.
Foley kin "told ... many times" they might be charged for raising ransom, his mother says.
Diana Foley adds: "We were just told to trust that he would be freed somehow, miraculously".
