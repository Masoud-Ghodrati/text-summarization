Video shows Planned Parenthood staffer apparently counseling a woman on gender-selective abortion.
"Just continue and try again" if the fetus turns out to be female, the counselor says.
Planned Parenthood says the counselor is no longer working for the organization.
She "did not follow our protocol," says the group's vice president for education.
