Maj. Nidal Hasan is charged with 13 counts of murder and 32 counts of attempted murder.
Hasan admitted in court he was the Fort Hood shooter.
He tried to plead guilty to the charges, but was barred from doing so under military law.
"If I died by lethal injection I would still be a martyr," he said in a mental health evaluation.
