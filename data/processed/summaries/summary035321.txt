About 10,000 women were sent to work in the Magdalen Laundries, a report finds.
More than a quarter were referred there by the Irish state, it finds.
Advocacy groups say the women were seriously abused and deserve compensation.
The report finds conditions were "harsh and physically demanding" but not abusive.
