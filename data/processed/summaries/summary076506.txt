Bob Greene's friend found the hospital bill from his birth in 1947. It was $70, $726 in 2012 dollars.
He says the price of a hospital birth in 2008 was $11,000. Why is it so expensive now?.
He says huge pricetag is partly due to advanced technology that has greatly cut infant mortality.
Greene: Some say not all costly procedures necessary, but outcomes are better now.
