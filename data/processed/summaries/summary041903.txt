Workers from Market Basket are protesting and calling for their ex-CEO to be reinstated.
Sally Kohn: Market Basket, until it changed CEO recently, has been a great place to work.
She says like Occupy Wall Street, Market Basket workers want shared prosperity.
Kohn: But current leaders of Market Basket are greedy and cater to shareholders.
