Saltwater crocodile Elvis is the largest in New South Wales, the reptile park says.
The croc grabbed the lawnmower while keepers were cutting grass in his enclosure.
He reportedly joined the reptile park in 2008 after becoming a nuisance in Darwin Harbor.
The creature's teeth measure up to 9 centimeters (3.5 inches) in length.
