Shia LaBeouf formally charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct, harassment.
He lit up a cigarette, disrupted a play, police say; he was staggering, theatergoers say.
They say they thought he was putting on an act, studying for a new role.
LaBeouf has made an art of apologizing in an acting piece he calls #IAMSORRY.
