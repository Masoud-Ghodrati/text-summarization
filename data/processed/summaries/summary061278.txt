OPCW says it has approved a detailed plan to destroy Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
A U.N. resolution authorized a mission to oversee weapons destruction.
Weapons inspectors began checking chemical sites in the war-torn country in October.
A location for destruction of weapons outside Syria has not yet been announced.
