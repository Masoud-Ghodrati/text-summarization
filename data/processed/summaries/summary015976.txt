Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda is Japan's sixth head of government in five years.
Japan is still recovering from last year's quake, tsunami and resulting nuclear plant meltdown.
Japan and the U.S. agreed last week to relocate some U.S. troops based on Okinawa.
Noda and Obama hold bilateral talks, then a working lunch and a news conference.
