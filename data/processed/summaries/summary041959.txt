Nikon cancels a photo exhibition by Ahn Sehong on Japan's comfort women in Tokyo.
Photographer says he believes it demonstrates discrimination against the women.
"Comfort women" is the term given to Korean women used as sex slaves by Japanese soldiers.
Now in their 80s and 90s, the women are living their final years in poverty in rural China.
