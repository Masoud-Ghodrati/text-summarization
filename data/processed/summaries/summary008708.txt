Bob Greene ran into a group of older men at a hotel; turned out to be WWII military men.
The 63rd Infantry Division, which fought in France and Germany, has held reunions for decades.
Now, with few remaining of a force once 15,000 strong, the reunions are likely finished.
Greene: The men feel bonded, have been through much; still have each other.
