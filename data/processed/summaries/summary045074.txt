NASCAR driver Tony Stewart's car hit and killed driver Kevin Ward Jr. during race.
Paul Callan: Sheriff likely to look at Stewart's bad boy image and amateur video of crash.
Callan: Still, sheriff says, no evidence of criminal intent on Stewart's part.
Callan: Ward recklessly walked onto track; Stewart had right to think that would not happen.
