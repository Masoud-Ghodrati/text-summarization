President Jimmy Carter nominated Griffin Bell as attorney general in 1976.
Bell credited with helping restore confidence in Justice Department in late 1970s.
His "integrity, professionalism, and charm" valued across party lines, Carter said.
In 2004, he was listed among Georgia Dems who endorsed Bush for re-election.
