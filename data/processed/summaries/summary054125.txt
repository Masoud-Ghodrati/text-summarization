Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase is found guilty of blackmail.
Both he and his wife, who was convicted on a separate charge, are put on probation.
Nastase has said the trial was ordered by his political rival, President Traian Basescu.
Nastase was convicted in January on separate corruption charges.
