Two Musudan missiles have been sent to a storage facility, a U.S. official says.
The U.S. and South Korea said previously the missiles could be fired at any time.
The disclosure comes after the intensity of North Korea threats has calmed.
But Pyongyang warns the U.S. and South Korea over naval drills in the region.
