Newtown parents emerge from isolation after son's death in school massacre.
They remember Dylan Hockley, 6, as always smiling and full of joy.
Dylan was found wrapped in the arms of his teacher, according to the teacher's husband.
They lived down the street from Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people at Sandy Hook school.
