Turkey's Dalyan Delta was used as the backdrop for the 1951 film "The African Queen".
June Haimoff, who came to Dalyan in the 1970s, was instrumental in blocking plans to build a hotel complex.
Haimoff, known as Kaptan June among locals, has dedicated her life to saving the local loggerhead turtles.
