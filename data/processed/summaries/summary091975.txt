Australian rugby league player Chris Houston charged with dealing drugs.
He will appear in court next month, accused of supplying cocaine and ecstasy.
His Newcastle clubmate Danny Wicks was also charged with dealing in December.
Newcastle and Australia star Andrew Johns admitted using ecstasy in 2007.
