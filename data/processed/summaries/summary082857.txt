Overseas groups have reported that three Tibetans set fire to themselves in China.
Local Chinese officials tell a state-run newspaper that the self-immolations didn't happen.
The Chinese authorities' accounts have regularly differed with those of advocacy groups.
The reports come after a clampdown by Chinese security forces in the region.
