Mark Ciavarella was ordered to pay about $1 million in restitution.
In February, Ciavarella was confronted by a distraught mother outside a courtroom.
Sandy Fonzo said her son killed himself after receiving an unjust sentence from Ciavarella.
"Do you remember my son? He's gone. He shot himself in the heart, you scumbag!".
