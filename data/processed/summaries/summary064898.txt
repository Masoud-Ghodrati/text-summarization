NEW: The judge is lenient because of the youth of the killer and the circumstances.
Daniel Fitzsimons, 30, is the first Westerner to be tried in Iraq since the war began in 2003.
Fitzsimons admitted shooting two colleagues, Paul McGuigan and Darren Hoare.
But he pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he shot the men in self-defense.
