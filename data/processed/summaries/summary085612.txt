Nick Leeson is dubbed the 'original rogue trader' for bad trades which collapsed Barings Bank.
Leeson now lives in Ireland and has joined GDP Partnership, an Irish restructuring firm.
Leeson said his time in a jail, with drug lords and sex offenders, made him consider taking his own life.
But he survived incarceration and colon cancer and has since rebuilt his life.
