AEG Live's John Meglin disputed an estimate of how much Michael Jackson could've earned.
An expert said Jackson would have earned at least $1.5 billion had he lived to age 66.
If jurors decide AEG Live is liable in Jackson's death, the estimate could guide damages.
A nurse who gave Jackson anesthesia is set to testify Thursday.
