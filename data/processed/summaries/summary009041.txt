Gene Seymour challenged for most of his life by other black people as "not black enough".
He says it's as wounding as a racial epithet from white person.
TV's "Black-ish" and "Dear White People" movie are taking on the subject.
Seymour: Both show there as are many ways to be black as there are to be white, or brown.
