NEW: A highlight is an 1866-S No Motto Double Eagle valued at close to $1 million.
The coins, in $5, $10 and $20 denominations, are dated from 1847 to 1894.
They have a combined face value of about $27,000 but could fetch $10 million or more.
The discovery is thought to be the largest of its kind in U.S. history.
