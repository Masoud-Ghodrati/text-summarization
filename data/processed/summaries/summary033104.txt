President Obama is criticizing influx of campaign money from undisclosed donors.
Julian Zelizer says Obama campaigned in 2008 for finance reform.
Once in office, president dropped the issue to focus on other things, Zelizer says.
Obama chose to live within existing system rather than reform it, he says.
