Hawks GM Danny Ferry allegedly described Luol Deng as a "two-faced liar and cheat".
"He has a little African in him," Ferry said, according to a letter from a team owner.
Deng says he's disappointed and disturbed by the comments but proud of his heritage.
Ferry says he was repeating comments from other sources that don't reflect his views.
