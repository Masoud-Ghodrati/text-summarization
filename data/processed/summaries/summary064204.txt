Mellow Johnny's is a cycling store co-owned by disgraced former cyclist Lance Armstrong.
The store is in Armstrong hometown of Austin, Texas.
Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and banned for life from cycling.
Some cycling fans in Austin still stand by Armstrong despite doping allegations.
