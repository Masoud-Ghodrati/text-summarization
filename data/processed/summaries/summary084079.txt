Hosni Mubarak is sentenced to life in prison for his role in the killing of protesters.
Supporters slam his conviction, while anti-Mubarak protesters call for a harsher penalty.
He ruled the country for 30 years before his ouster as president in February last year.
The judge orders Mubarak's transfer to a maximum security prison.
