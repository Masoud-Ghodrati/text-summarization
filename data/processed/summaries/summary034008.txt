Hilary Lister has become the first disabled woman to sail around Britain.
She navigated with a special technology using only her mouth and a straw.
Hilary suffers from a rare degenerative disease that has made her paraplegic.
She wants to help other disabled sailors through her charity Hilary's Dream Trust.
