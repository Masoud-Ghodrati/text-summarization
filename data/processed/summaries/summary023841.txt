A new coroner's inquest into Amy Winehouse's death will begin on January 8.
The assistant deputy coroner who ruled on the death did not have required legal credentials.
The original coroner's report concluded it was a "death by misadventure".
Winehouse was found dead at her north London home July 23, 2011.
