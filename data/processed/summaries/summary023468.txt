Supplies from a Libyan-backed ship still being sorted out in Egypt.
The ship is carrying aid for Gaza, and is docked at the Egyptian port of Al Arish.
The ship attempted to break an Israeli naval blockade of Gaza, but was diverted.
Israeli soldiers killed nine activists aboard another aid ship in May.
