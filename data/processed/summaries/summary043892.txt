23 years ago, a bus crash forever changed the life of Joshua Prager.
Prager's broken neck led to paralysis; only half his body functions normally.
He visited others affected by crash, learned that they accept it as God's will.
Prager: I see the crash as result of a dangerous road and poor truck driver.
