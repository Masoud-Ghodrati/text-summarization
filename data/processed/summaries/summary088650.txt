A mostly minority day care paid a suburban Philly swim club for access, then was denied.
State and federal agencies filed lawsuits, accusing the club of racial discrimination.
The 2 sides reach a settlement, nearly three years after the club filed for bankruptcy.
Children, counselors and the day care will share tens of thousands of dollars.
