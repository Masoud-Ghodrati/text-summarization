English golfer Chris Wood wins Qatar Masters by one shot after spectacular finish.
He heads off Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia and South Africa's George Coetzee.
The 25-year-old qualifies for next month's WGC-Accenture Match Play in Arizona.
Garcia denied a return to top-10 rankings as he tied for second place with Coetzee.
