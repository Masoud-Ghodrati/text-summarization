Nelson Mandela called on everyone to do something to make the world a better place.
There are many ways to carry on Mandela's struggle for justice and equality.
Mandela fought racism, increased HIV/AIDS awareness and improved the lives of children.
No matter what the cause is that is dear to your heart, stand up for it because Mandela did.
