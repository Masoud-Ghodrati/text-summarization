CNN's Errol Barnett visited the Table Mountain in Cape Town, South Africa.
A descendant of Khoi, the first people to live near the mountain showed Barnett a sacred place.
Barnett also met an environmentalist to learn about water protection in the region.
The journey ended with a breathtaking view as Barnett reached the top of the mountain.
