The U.S. issued a statement criticizing China on South China Sea territorial disputes.
A Chinese spokesman responds by claiming the U.S. shows a "total disregard for the facts".
The U.S. confounded "right and wrong" and undermined peace in the region, he adds.
There are international disputes about who controls islands and waters in the South China Sea.
