NEW: China launches the space lab module Tiangong-1, which means "heavenly palace" in Chinese.
The 8.5-ton module is part of an experiment to test space rendezvous and docking capabilities.
China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003, part of a "three-step" strategy to develop a space station.
