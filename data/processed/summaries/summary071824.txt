More than four million people have visited poppy art installation at Tower of London.
"Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red" is made up of more than 880,000 ceramic flowers.
Each poppy represents a British or Colonial soldier killed in World War I.
Final bloom will be planted on 11 November; flowers will then be "picked" and sold.
