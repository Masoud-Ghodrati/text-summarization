Video surfaced on YouTube last week of Peruvian general's anti-Chile remarks.
Gen. Edwin Donayre said Chileans in Peru would go home in coffins or body bags.
Donayre made the remarks in a toast at a party in 2006 or 2007, CNN affiliate reports.
Peru's president tells Chile the remarks do not reflect Peruvian policy.
