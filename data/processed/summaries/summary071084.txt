NEW: The first of 2 tugboats that will tow the ship to Alabama arrives, Carnival says.
NEW: The cruise ship will go to the U.S., not Mexico, due to currents and "simpler re-entry".
An engine room fire disabled the ship; passengers report many issues aboard.
A Carnival spokesman admits problems on ship but points to progress.
