Gene Sharp, an American academic, is among those tipped to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
Egypt's "Mama Maggie," a Coptic Christian nun who helps Cairo's poorest, could also win.
The five-member Nobel committee will choose from 231 nominees.
Last year's prize was shared by Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkul Karman.
