Alister MacKenzie, a physician turned golf architect, designed famed Augusta National course.
The Scot was enlisted to help by Bobby Jones, a multiple golf champion of the 1920s.
MacKenzie never received full payment for his work and died before first Masters was held.
Many of his design principles still permeate the course despite many changes over the years.
