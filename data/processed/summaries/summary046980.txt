Professor Debra Moriarity is a colleague of alleged shooter Amy Bishop, she says.
Bishop started shooting about an hour into a faculty meeting, says Moriarity.
Moriarity: "It was actually a really laid-back, mundane kind of faculty meeting".
Moriarity: "I grabbed her leg. ... I was just thinking: 'Grab her!' ".
