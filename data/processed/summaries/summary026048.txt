Forces go door to door in Hama telling people to evacuate before demolition begins, residents say.
Bulldozers have razed 120 buildings and remain active in the area, a resident says.
The district, which once had 30,000 people, was a hotbed for "peaceful and militant" opposition.
The razings and intimidation of residents have "only fueled more anger," the resident adds.
