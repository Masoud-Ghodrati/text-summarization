Frida Ghitis: Russia, Egypt, other "populist" states show faltering democracy in stifled speech.
She says Pussy Riot sentence and jailing of Putin critics are recent examples.
She says Ecuador, Venezuela, Egypt use laws, intimidation to "coercively pre-empt" criticism.
Ghitis: Democracy real only if it allows the powerful flow of ideas; without that, it's a mirage.
