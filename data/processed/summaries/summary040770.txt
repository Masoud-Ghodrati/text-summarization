Space shuttle Atlantis blasts off Monday on final visit to the Hubble Space Telescope.
It's been seven years since NASA's last Hubble servicing mission in 2002.
Astronauts will complete five grueling space walks some 350 miles up in space.
In its 19 years in orbit, the Hubble has changed our understanding of the universe.
