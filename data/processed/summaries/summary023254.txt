The attack occurred Wednesday in the ethnically mixed town of Tuz Khurmatu.
Among the injured is Ahmed Abdul-Wahed, deputy governor of Salaheddin province.
Last week, a series of car and roadside bombs targeted buses and bus stations.
Uptick in violence has coincided with three weeks of protests in Sunni provinces.
