Musician Joe Finley auditioned for a TV show even though his wife had been found dead.
Authorities say they are still investigating the death; Finley says her death is "murder".
Finley says police tried to get him to confess, but he says he had nothing to do with her death.
He's offering a $25,000 reward for the person responsible for his wife's death.
