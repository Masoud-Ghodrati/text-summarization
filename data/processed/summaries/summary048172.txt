France's rail operators face embarrassment after a mixup led to trains being ordered that can't fit through some stations.
Media reports say operator RFF took measurements from newer stations, overlooking hundreds of older, narrower platforms.
RFF and and train company SNCF say a budget of 50 million euros is being spent on upgrading 1,300 platforms.
