Nigeria's claim of a truce with Boko Haram raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls.
But Boko Haram's leader Abubakar Shekau issued a video denying any ceasefire.
Shekau said he did not know the negotiator claiming to represent Boko Haram.
The girls kidnapped from Chibok, he said, had converted to Islam and been married off.
