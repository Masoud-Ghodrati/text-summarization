Security firm: Global cyberattack was launched from more than 100,000 everyday appliances.
Gadgets included routers, televisions and at least one "smart" refrigerator.
Proofpoint said the attack occurred between December 23 and January 6.
Poorly protected "smart" devices may be easier to infect and control than PC, laptops, or tablets.
