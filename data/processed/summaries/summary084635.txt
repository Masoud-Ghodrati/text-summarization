Police say 7 militants on motorcycles attacked the parked oil tankers Thursday night.
The tankers had been parked since Pakistan shut down NATO supply routes last month.
Closing the routes was a response to NATO airstrike that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.
No injuries reported in the attacks on tankers; police say the attackers escaped.
