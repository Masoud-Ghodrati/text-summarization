Steve Ortiz posted a used cell phone on Craigslist under the barter section.
Ortiz bartered up cell for iPod touch, computer, dirt bike, SUV and then a Porsche.
He says anyone can do it, but warns it takes patience and a lot of research.
"It's trying to catch people who want what you have," Ortiz told CNN's "American Morning".
