The English Channel is home to the world's busiest shipping lanes.
More than 500 vessels pass through the straight that is only 34 kilometers across at its shortest navigable point.
Some of the world's biggest cargo ships ply the Channel alongside smaller objects such as yachts, fishing boats and swimmers.
