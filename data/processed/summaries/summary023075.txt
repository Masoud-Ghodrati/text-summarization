Westboro Baptist Church brings anti-gay message to soldiers' funerals.
Father of a Marine who died a hero in Iraq sued; the case is now before U.S. Supreme Court.
The church defends its "highly disliked" speech as "needing protection".
One other lawsuit against the church could reach the high court next year.
