Koch-backed super PAC is pushing two TV ads worth over $1.1 million to defeat Greg Orman.
Orman, an independent, could cast the deciding vote in deciding control of the Senate.
Orman hasn't said who he would caucus with, but Republicans are painting him as a Democrat-in-disguise.
The ad buy follows the same group's $6.5 million injection into 6 other competitive states.
