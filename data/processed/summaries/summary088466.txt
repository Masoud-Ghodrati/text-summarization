Bob Greene says Kirk Douglas is Hollywood's last remaining Golden Age idol.
In "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," he played a seafarer and sang a memorable song.
Greene watched a TV version in which song was cut; he called Douglas, who was appalled.
Greene: Douglas turns 96 today, has come far from his early N.Y. days as Issur Danielovitch.
