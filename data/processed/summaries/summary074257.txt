Measure H.R. 1 could cut  93% of federal funding for poison control centers.
House passed H.R. 1 but Senate rejected it; cut could still be in a final, negotiated bill.
Centers answered 4.2 million calls in 2009; about 16% of those came from hospitals.
The cuts are meant to eliminate all but one of the nation's 57 poison control centers.
