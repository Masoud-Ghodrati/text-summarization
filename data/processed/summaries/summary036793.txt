Rick Wade says Magic Johnson has put his money where his mouth is in the urban market.
Donald Sterling criticized Johnson: "What does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything.".
Sterling, says Wade, is just dead wrong.
Johnson has invested in real estate, theaters, restaurants, sports teams and Starbucks franchises.
