Libya's instability is indicative of an ineffective government, says Sara ElGaddari.
General Khalifa Haftar and the Zintan militia are stepping into the power vacuum, she says.
But ElGaddari says Haftar and rebel militias are directly contributing to Libya's instability.
She says the international community cannot let Libya fail and must help its government.
