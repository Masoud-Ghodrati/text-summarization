David Sutherland, U.S. brigade commander in Iraq, says it's hard to watch country fall apart.
As U.S. begins airstrikes, he questions whether terrible losses from Iraq War are worth it.
He says U.S. spent $25 billion to train Iraq forces. It's time to take off the training wheels.
Sutherland: We need to focus on our own veterans, who have many needs unmet.
