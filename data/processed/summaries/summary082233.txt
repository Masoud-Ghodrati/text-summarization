Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday will discuss Spain.
Spain was told to cut difference between its income and spending to within 5.3% of GDP.
But ministers will probably revise that goal upward to 6.3% Monday, EU sources say.
Official: The ministers want "more of an agreement in principle" than a commitment.
