Apple is updating its Siri voice assistant feature on Wednesday.
Siri will get an optional male voice and will integrate Twitter and Wikipedia results.
Siri faces stiff competition from Google's Voice Search, which can also be used on the iPhone.
As part of the overhaul, Siri is no longer labeled a "beta" product.
