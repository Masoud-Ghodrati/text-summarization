NEW: Police have identified the deceased as 49-year-old Larry McQuilliams.
He was an Austin resident and had a criminal history, authorities say.
A police sergeant shot at the gunman while holding two horses, police chief says.
The chief speculates that angry, unhealthy political rhetoric may have fed into the attack.
