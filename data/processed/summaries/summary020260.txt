ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi may have been wounded in an airstrike.
Even if he gets killed, a throng of "very professional leaders" could take his place.
Al-Baghdadi has two top deputies, one over operations in Iraq and one over Syria.
The Shura Council, ISIS' religious monitor, could tell al-Baghdadi to go.
