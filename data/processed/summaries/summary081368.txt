The Iranian suspect is wanted by the Thai authorities in relation to a string of blasts in Bangkok.
Masoud Sedaghatzadeh was arrested in Kuala Lumpur a day after the bombings.
A judge rules he can be extradited, but Sedaghatzadeh plans to apply to be released.
Two other Iranian suspects are being held in Thailand, while two more are still at large.
