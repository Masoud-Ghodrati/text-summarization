Defence expenditure is budgeted to rise to Rmb670.247bn ($110bn) in 2012.
The rate of increase is slightly lower than last year's 12.7% but in line with the growth trajectory over the past two decades.
The increase comes as the U.S. is cutting defense spending while at the same time shifting its focus to Asia-Pacific.
