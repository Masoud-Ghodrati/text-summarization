Miranda Lynch started Isipho to fight hunger and poverty in Inzinga, South Africa.
She came up with the idea after visiting the village with her dad when she was 12.
Isipho provides fencing, seeds and training so schools and families can plant gardens.
You can help Isipho and other organizations fight hunger around the world.
