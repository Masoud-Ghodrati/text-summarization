GOP consultant Margaret Hoover says her party missed the boat in 2012 with millennials.
Obama won the millennial vote by 34 percentage points in 2008 and 23 points in 2012.
Republican stances on marriage and immigration turn away millennials, Hoover says.
GOP should emphasize its strong points -- fiscal conservatism, national defense.
