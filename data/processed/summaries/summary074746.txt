Scientists say the three new species have been isolated in forest for millions of years.
Discovered species include leaf-tail gecko, golden skink and a boulder-dwelling frog.
Herpetologist: Gecko is "strangest new species to come across my desk in 26 years".
Finding species in "lost world" of Cape Melville is "discovery of a lifetime," scientist says.
