1909 card of Pittsburgh Pirate shortstop Honus Wagner is one of only about 50 in existence.
The buyer remains anonymous but is called "a wealthy individual investor and a baseball fan".
There were 15 bids made for the prized item.
The card is rare because Wagner made the American Tobacco Company recall it.
