The superintendent of Philadelphia public schools gives an ultimatum.
If the district doesn't get $50 million by Friday, schools won't open on time.
The district had to lay off 3,800 employees this summer due to a financial shortfall.
Philadelphia's mayor call's the ultimatum "chilling"; he backs the superintendent.
