"Marathon men" John Isner and Nicolas Mahut have forged close friendship.
Their first round match at Wimbledon in 2010 is the longest in tennis history.
By the end of their 11-hour match they'd become famous the world over.
Isner speaks regularly to Mahut who he calls one of the "classiest guys on tour".
