NEW: Anti-government protesters call off a rally they had planned for Tuesday.
Rally called off because 1,500 troops have been stationed along a Bangkok road.
Protesters demanding PM dissolve government, hold new elections and leave country.
At least 25 people killed in deadly police-protester clashes earlier this month.
