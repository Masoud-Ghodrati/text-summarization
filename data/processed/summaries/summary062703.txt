Jeremy Shane advocates changing the way guns work with "smart" technology.
Shane: Today's guns are "dumb," and making them the same way is thoughtless.
He says gun software can start with locational "self-awareness" and other simple features.
Shane: Technologists should use their know-how to help reduce gun violence.
