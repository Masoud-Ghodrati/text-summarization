Petit calls the verdict "a relief," describing Komisarjevsky as "a lying sociopathic personality".
"I personally felt this case was a case about sexual predation," Petit says.
Sentencing phase of the trial is set for 10 a.m. EDT on Oct. 24.
As the verdict is read, the victims' family members weep openly.
