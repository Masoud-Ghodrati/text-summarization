Ronaldo has announced his retirement from football after an 18-year career.
The two-time World Cup winner said the decision was down to injury and a lack of fitness.
The three-time World Player of the Year also revealed he suffers from hypothyroidism.
The medication required to treat the illness is banned under football's anti-doping rules.
