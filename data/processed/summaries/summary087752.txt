Jason Dufner celebrates his first ever major title with success at U.S. PGA Championship.
Dufner says he might celebrate by doing a spot of 'Dufnering' pose with his trophy.
The 36-year-old was teased by fellow pros for falling asleep on a school visit in Dallas.
Dufner insists his first major victory won't change him one bit as a person.
