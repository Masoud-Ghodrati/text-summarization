New Zealand's capital to host the premiere of Peter Jackson's adaptation of "The Hobbit".
Even Air New Zealand has gotten into the spirit, with a Hobbit-inspired "elf n safety" video.
Other Hollywood blockbusters filmed there include "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, "King Kong".
Jackson has warned that the country will have to do more to attract future big productions.
