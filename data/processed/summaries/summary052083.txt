Costume designer Lyn Paolo puts 'Scandal's' Olivia in pastels to show she's feminine, strong.
Paolo: Olivia dons cashmere and silk when she's at home because she's more vulnerable.
Olivia's "silhouettes are fairly consistent. ... It's a classic business look," Paolo says.
Paolo: Olivia will carry a new Prada purse on season 2.
