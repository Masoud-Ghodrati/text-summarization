Organ in St. Paul's Chapel in New York had been silent since September 11, 2001.
The instrument's builders removed 2.5 gallons of dirt and debris left by 9/11 attacks.
Organist's Good Friday rehearsal marks instrument's return to functionality.
After attacks, historic chapel was makeshift bunker for recovery and relief workers.
