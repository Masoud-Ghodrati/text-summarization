Volcano safari tours in Iceland involve driving up Eyjafjallajokull in a giant-wheeled 4x4 super jeep.
In 2010 eruptions from Eyjafjallajokull grounded thousands of transatlantic flights and stranded millions.
Other volcanic attractions include Bardarbunga, which has been erupting since August 2014.
