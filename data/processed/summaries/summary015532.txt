Meg Urry: New data have mapped a "superwind" flowing out of a nearby galaxy.
Urry: There is enough mass in the wind to carry away a lot of gas in the galaxy.
She says this suggests an answer to why galaxies today do not have more stars.
Urry: It's because cold gas, which forms stars, is being blown out of galaxies.
