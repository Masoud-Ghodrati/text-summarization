Iranian state news reports a monkey strapped inside a capsule launches into space.
An Iranian minister calls the monkey's trip "the first step for sending humans into space".
A U.S. official says such a launch, if confirmed, violates a U.N. Security Council resolution.
Animals have been used for space launches before, to prepare for human flights.
