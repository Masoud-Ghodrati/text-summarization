Helena Costa is first female to be given top coaching job in top two tiers of Europe's big five leagues.
"Look at me as a normal coach," says the new boss of French club Clermont Foot.
The 36-year-old hopes her appointment "can open doors" for other female coaches.
The Portuguese coach is dubbed "Mourinho in a skirt" in her home country.
