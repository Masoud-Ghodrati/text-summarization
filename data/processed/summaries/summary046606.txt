Homeland Security says Jose Antonio Vargas has a notice to appear in court.
Officials say he was detained after telling authorities he was in the country illegally.
The journalist wrote last week that he suspected he might not get out of McAllen, Texas.
At 12, Vargas came to the U.S. illegally with a man he'd never met, he wrote in 2011.
