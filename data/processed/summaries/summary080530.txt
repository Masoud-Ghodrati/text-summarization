Elizabeth Meyer risked her life's worth to restore 1930s America's Cup yacht Endeavour.
The painstaking restoration of a shell of a boat led to a resurgence in classic yachting.
Meyer has family links to both the World Bank and the Watergate scandal.
The J-Class yachts she restores were seen as the pinnacle of sail boats.
