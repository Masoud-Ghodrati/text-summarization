Kissinger used a short speech on Wednesday to joke about Clinton 2016.
He appeared with five other secretaries of state.
Kissinger said for "all of us, except one" the job was the most challenging of their lives.
He has told NPR that Clinton "would be a good president" but he'd still vote Republican.
