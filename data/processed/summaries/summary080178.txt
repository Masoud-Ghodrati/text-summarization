Alan P. Gross was sentenced to 15 years in prison for crimes against the Cuban state.
Gross, 61, was found guilty of working on a "subversive" project for the U.S. government.
U.S. has said Gross was helping Cuba's Jewish community connect to the internet.
The U.S. says the ruling "adds another injustice to Alan Gross's ordeal".
