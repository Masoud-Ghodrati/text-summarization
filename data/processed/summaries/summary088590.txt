A university student leader thinks Gov. Bobby Jindal should spend more time at home.
The student wrote a letter published in a New Hamshire newspaper.
The letter says Jindal "is spending more time in your state" than his home state.
A spokesman for the governor says he's spent 90 percent of his time in Louisiana.
