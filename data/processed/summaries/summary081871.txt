Women in Mosul, northern Iraq, must practice sports behind closed, locked doors.
Many men and women disapprove of women in sport and are against mixed gender training.
Situation is different outside of Mosul where there is a more positive view of women in sport.
Some use wearing of hijab as excuse to say women cannot compete effectively in sports.
