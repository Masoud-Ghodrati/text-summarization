Ruben Navarrette: 80% of San Diegans want embarrassing Mayor Bob Filner to resign.
So far, 16 women accuse Filner of sexual harassment, inappropriate touching.
Navarrette calls him a narcissist who wants to lead so badly he doesn't care no one wants him.
He says Filner could drag Democratic Party down with him, and give county back to GOP.
