James Seevakumaran's roommate says, "I was not going to let him shoot me".
Seevakumaran, 30, had about 1,000 rounds of ammo and four homemade bombs, police say.
Video shows him pulling a fire alarm, then returning to his UCF room where his weapons were.
Seevakumaran's family calls him a loner; authorities don't know his motive for the alleged plot.
