The CNM Estates Fine Art Sails regatta debuted this weekend at London's Royal Victoria Dock.
Olympic and World Championship sailors took to the water bearing sails adorned with contemporary artwork.
Organizers say the concept marks a first of its kind collaboration between art and top-class sailing.
