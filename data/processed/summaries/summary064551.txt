Former NBA player Chris Herren struggled with drug addiction for 14 years.
He had many "rock bottom" moments, including shooting up at his mother's funeral.
When he decided to get sober, he was faced with expensive rehab.
Today, he runs a foundation to help others pay for effective addiction treatment.
