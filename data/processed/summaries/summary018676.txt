Michaelangelo Matos: Impossible to imagine past 50 years of rock without Lou Reed.
He says glam, punk and all alt rock in his debt; Stones, U2, REM among those influenced.
His music transgressed, with topics such as S&M, hard drugs; his view alienated, he says.
Matos: Rock was Reed's poetry, and he became paterfamilias to NYC's rock scene.
