Mickey Rourke has spent 15 years battling his way back to the top.
After a promising start, he threw away his career with self-destructive behavior.
Rourke on losing everything: "You've got to look in the mirror and go 'It's your fault'".
He has been in therapy for 13 years and says he was "afraid of change".
