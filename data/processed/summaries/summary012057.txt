Bonhams auctioneers selling more than 70 Eric Clapton guitars.
Collector, CNN editorial chief and sometime musician Tony Maddox explains the joy of guitars.
Provenance and a star owner are often key to a good sale price, Maddox says.
In 2004 Clapton's Blackie guitar sold for $959,000; this sale has a reproduction of the iconic instrument.
