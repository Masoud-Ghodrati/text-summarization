A group of professional tree climbers are on a mission to scale Africa's tallest trees.
They want to raise awareness about their protection by showcasing them to the world.
'It's all about celebrating trees, educating people,' says co-founder David Wiles.
The group has also helped install nest boxes for the endangered cape parrot.
