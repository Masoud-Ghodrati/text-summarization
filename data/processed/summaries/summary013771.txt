Two boys plot to kill a girl outside their Washington state school unravels.
The boys also intended to kill six more students one by one, authorities say.
One boy was going to stab the girl; the other was to use a gun to guard him.
One boy stole the gun from his older brother, who in turn stole it from dead grandfather's home.
