NEW: U.S. education secretary praises coach's "courageous role" in Alzheimer's fight.
"The time has come to move into the future and step into a new role," Pat Summitt says.
She will remain involved in mentoring players and recruiting, the university says.
In August, Summitt revealed she had early-onset Alzheimer's.
