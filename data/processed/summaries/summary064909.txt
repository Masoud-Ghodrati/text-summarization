Aubrey "Lee" Price is suspected of defrauding more than 100 investors of at least $17 million.
Price, 46, was last spotted in Key West, Florida, in mid-June.
Federal investigators believe Price, who owns property abroad, may be on the run.
He purportedly said in a letter he planned to commit suicide by "jumping off a ferry boat".
