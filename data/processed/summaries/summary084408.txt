Rudy Giuliani says the shooting in Ferguson is not a reflection of race relations in national crime.
Giuliani: "White police officers wouldn't be there if you weren't killing each other 75% of the time".
Ex-New York mayor: Focus should pivot toward reducing crime in black community.
Michael Eric Dyson: Those remarks "reinforce [a] problematic perspective".
