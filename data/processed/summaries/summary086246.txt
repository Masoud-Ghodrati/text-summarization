NEW: Investigation of the plane wreckage at the crash site is complete.
Two survivors upgraded from fair to serious condition, while another remains critical.
One witness tells CNN the plane was "messed up," but the crash was survivable.
Stevens' funeral will be held next Wednesday in Anchorage, Alaska.
