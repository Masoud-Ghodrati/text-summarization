"The Vampire Diaries" is heading into its fourth season, which premieres on October 11.
Costume designer Leigh Leverett outfits the supernatural characters on the series.
Leverett: It's a challenge, but "I enjoy (costuming) flashbacks most of all".
Period pieces that aren't made in-house are often rented from costume companies.
