Julian Zelizer: Netflix show depicts Washington in which power is used ruthlessly.
He says the show is compelling but paints too dark a portrait of the nation's capital.
Political leaders used power to end threats and attain social justice, he says.
Zelizer: Enjoy show, but don't take it as statement about limits of American politics.
