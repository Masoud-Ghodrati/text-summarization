NEW: Flags will be at half-staff at the Ohio Statehouse and in Geauga County, the governor says.
Witnesses say student T.J. Lane walked up to a table and started firing.
He was then chased out by a teacher and arrested, witnesses and authorities say.
A friend says that Lane seemed like "a very normal, just teenage boy".
