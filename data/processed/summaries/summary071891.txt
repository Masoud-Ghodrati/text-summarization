Google releases a revamped Zagat site and apps on Monday.
This is the first time Zagat reviews can be accessed free and without registration.
Zagat scores restaurants, nightlife, stores and points of interest on a scale of one to 30.
The apps and site will only cover nine cities to start but more are coming soon.
