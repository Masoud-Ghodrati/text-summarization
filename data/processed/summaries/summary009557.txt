Thomas Eric Duncan was admitted to a Dallas hospital for Ebola on September 28.
He got an experimental drug October 4; others with Ebola got such drugs much faster.
Nephew: "He didn't get the medicine and treatment for the disease because he's African".
Hospital: Duncan was "treated the way any other patient would have been treated".
