CNN's Andrew Stevens was trying to get to Tacloban ahead of Typhoon Hagupit.
After multiple flight cancellations, he chartered a helicopter then rustled up a van from locals.
Trip normally takes 90 minutes with a direct flight from Manila.
Tacloban suffered the brunt of Super Typhoon Haiyan 13 months ago.
