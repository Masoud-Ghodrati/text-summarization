NEW: The penalty is the latest salvo in long-running dispute between Globovision and the government.
The broadcaster is fined 7.5% of its gross income for violating the law.
The government accuses the network of inciting anxiety in the public.
The $2.2 million fine could mean the end of Globovision.
