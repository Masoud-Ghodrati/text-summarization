Vincent August Sicari held down two careers -- one as a comedian, the other as a judge.
New Jersey's Supreme Court ruled unanimously that he must choose one or the other.
Sicari -- until today a municipal court judge in South Hackensack -- chose comedy.
Court ruled that parts of his act could cast doubt on his impartiality; Sicari disputed that.
