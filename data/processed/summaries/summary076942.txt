German authorities ask Justin Bieber to pay nearly $8,000 for the care of his monkey.
The monkey was seized in March after Bieber brought it on tour without the right paperwork.
German customs officials have made the bill public after failing to reach Bieber.
Bieber could be denied entry if he doesn't pay before he next comes to Germany -- official.
