Pope Benedict XVI in trouble for praise of World War II-era Pope Pius XII.
Pius is accused by critics of failing to speak out against Nazis and Holocaust.
Vatican says Benedict was just agreeing with panel considering Pius for sainthood.
Benedict angered Jews in January with support for Holocaust-denying bishop.
