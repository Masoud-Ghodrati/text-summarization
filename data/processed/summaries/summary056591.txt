The Jewish Voice from Germany newspaper unearths internal Nazi files on Ernst Hess.
Hess served in Hitler's infantry unit in World War I but didn't know him, then was a judge.
A 1940 order saved Hess, despite his Jewish heritage, "per the Fuhrer's wishes".
The order was revoked the next year, and Hess ended up in Nazi concentration camps.
