San Francisco Giants beat Texas Rangers 3-1 to win best-of-seven World Series 4-1.
Calfornia-based Giants ended fans' 56-year wait for a championship pennant.
It is the franchise's sixth in total but first since it moved from New York in 1958.
Rangers were playing in the first World Series final of the team's 50-year history.
