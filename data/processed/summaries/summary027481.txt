NEW: Only one production had a permit to fly helicopters in the area, a film bureau official says.
The Bell 206 Jet Ranger helicopter crashes around 3:30 a.m., an FAA spokesman says.
It's not known why it went down, though federal officials are investigating, he adds.
The crash is in Polsa Rosa Movie Ranch north of L.A., where some films have been shot.
