Finding: Sydney's captain, senior officers likely to have died in first salvo.
Sinking of Sydney II and loss of crew of 645 was Australia's worst naval disaster.
German vessel, the Kormoran, was made to look like a cargo ship.
Both ships went down; more than 300 on Kormoran survived; wrecks found last year.
