NEW: A lawyer for Knox says she "is very afraid but her heart is full of hope".
Another lawyer urges the jury to absolve Knox as he wraps up his closing argument.
A verdict in the appeal will not come before Monday, the judge says.
Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009 of killing Briton Meredith Kercher.
