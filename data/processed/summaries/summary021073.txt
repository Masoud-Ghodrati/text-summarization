China's high-speed rail network is now the world's busiest with daily ridership exceeding 1.3 million.
China launched the country's first high-speed service in 2007.
The rapid construction has raised doubts about the service's safety and commercial viability.
The government plans to complete a 25,000-kilometer high-speed network by 2020.
