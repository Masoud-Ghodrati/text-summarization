Yahya Abdi, 15, recounts his death-defying journey hiding in a plane wheel well.
He remembers seeing the ocean on his flight from California to Hawaii.
He randomly chose a plane going west in an effort to see his mom in Africa.
He advises others not to repeat his stunt because "they will end up dying".
