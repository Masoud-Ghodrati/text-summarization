New FAA  rule will require more cockpit time and other training for first officers.
FAA is mandating that co-pilots complete 1,500 hours total time as a pilot.
Previously, only 250 hours of flight time were required.
New rules prompted by 2009 Colgan crash; training an issue in Asiana accident as well.
