Oscar Pistorius will face two gun-related charges alongside a murder charge, prosecutors say.
He's due to go on trial in March for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
The athlete already faced the gun charges, but they have now been moved to the same court.
Pistorius admits shooting Steenkamp in his home but says it was an accident.
