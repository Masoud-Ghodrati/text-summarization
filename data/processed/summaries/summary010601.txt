ISIS has taken control of Sinjar in Iraq, home to members of the Yazidi religious minority.
Thousands fled from their homes, with some 30,000 families now stranded.
Maajid Nawaz says ISIS' hatred of the Yazidis is clear and a "new Kosovo" is transpiring.
He says rhetoric is not enough and the international community must take action to halt ISIS.
