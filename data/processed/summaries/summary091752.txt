Robert Mugabe fires his deputy, days after accusing her of plotting to kill him.
Vice President Joice Mujuru dismisses the allegations against her.
Mugabe has also fired eight Cabinet ministers, a government official says.
Mujuru was seen as a Mugabe successor, but his wife is now gaining political power.
