Eight to 10 guards provided paints to Htein Lin, smuggled his paintings out of prison.
Htein Lin said he was able to use art to demonstrate he is an artist, not a politician.
Original cloth paintings not for sale; were rendered onto canvas now on exhibition.
One guard destroyed 20 paintings, thinking one showed a prison map, Htein Lin said.
