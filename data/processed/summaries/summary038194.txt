The landmine crew of Afghan natives was on its way to clear areas of Herat province.
The abductors took the workers, their vehicles and their equipment to a village.
Then the workers were forced to go into the mountains.
Eight of the abducted fled; tribal leaders are being called on to help release those still held.
