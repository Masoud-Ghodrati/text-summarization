Brianne Gorod: D.C. Circuit panel got it wrong by dealing blow to how Obamacare works.
She says 4th Circuit ruling was right and that both challenges part of right's attempt to gut law.
D.C. Circuit ruled against federal subsidies for millions signed up, ignoring law's intent, she says.
Gorod: Review of decision by entire D.C. Circuit Court will likely reverse flawed decision.
