Secret Service and DEA agents were in Colombia in April, ahead of a presidential trip.
Nine Secret Service agents have lost their jobs for allegedly spending time with prostitutes.
No action has been taken against three DEA agents still under investigation.
The head of the DEA says "if there was misconduct, they will face our disciplinary process".
