Alan Henning is being held captive by ISIS militants, who have threatened his life.
Henning's wife speaks out because ISIS captors won't engage in "dialogue," she says.
She notes Muslims have called for Henning's release; Sharia courts found him to be no threat.
"He went to Syria to help his Muslim friends deliver much needed aid," she said.
