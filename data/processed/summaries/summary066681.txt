Autopsy reports on two U.S. security officers indicate they died of respiratory failure.
They may also have suffered heart attacks, a police statement says.
The bodies of the two men were found a week ago on the container ship Maersk Alabama.
Police report "includes suspicion of drug use" as syringe, traces of heroin were found.
