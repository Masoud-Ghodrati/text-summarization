Rick Francona: 72-hour cease-fire may prove to be end of this round of Gaza confrontation.
He says Israel achieved its objectives militarily by destroying tunnels, rockets.
Hamas can survive loss of manpower; it still has thousands of rockets, but it's weakened.
Francona: Too many died; this should be a chance to find a long-term peace.
