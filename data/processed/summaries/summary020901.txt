Errol Louis: Death of Eric Garner at hands of NYPD shows old police strategy that doesn't work.
Why such force used on man illegally selling cigarettes? Roots are in Bratton's first tenure.
Louis: It's an approach from '80s. Tackling "quality of life" crime brought crime rate down.
Louis: NYPD must take new look at how crime enforced in a much safer city in 2014.
