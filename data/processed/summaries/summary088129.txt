Edward Archbold was among those in a contest at a Deerfield Beach reptile store.
He won a python after eating dozens of cockroaches and worms, a sheriff's office says.
Archbold later fell ill, collapsed and was pronounced dead at a southeast Florida hospital.
The store says participants signed waivers, insects were "safely and domestically raised".
