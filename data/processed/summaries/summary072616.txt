A northern California sheriff's office says a son stabbed his father with scissors.
The son, 27, then cut off his hands with a radial-arm saw, authorities say.
Both father and son had life-threatening injuries but were still alive the next day.
"I just can't imagine anything like that happening between family," a neighbor says.
