Al-Shabaab chief Mukhtar Abu Zubayr has a reputation for being secretive, merciless.
Zubayr, 36, wants his group to be able to deliver devastating attacks beyond Somalia.
Last year, he formally declared Al-Shabaab an affiliate of al Qaeda.
Zubayr's harsh tactics have led to dissent in his group, which he has ruthlessly suppressed.
