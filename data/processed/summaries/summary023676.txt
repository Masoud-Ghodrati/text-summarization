Dorothy Brown: It's unusual to get a tax break for a personal choice such as buying a home.
Renting is not deductible, she says, even though about one-third of Americans are renters.
Brown: Tax break meant to "encourage homeownership," but people buy homes anyway.
Tax break is a $200 billion subsidy every year for those with higher incomes, she says.
