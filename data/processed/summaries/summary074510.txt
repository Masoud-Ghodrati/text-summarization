Olympian Amy Van Dyken-Rouen was left paralyzed after a June 6 ATV accident.
Gold medalist swimmer calls new life a "rebirth," but "I have my bad days," she admits.
Thoughts, prayers and "positive vibes" have kept her going, she says.
She is headed next to Colorado to continue her physical therapy.
