NEW: Olympus board will appoint a panel to decide on legal action against ex-executives.
An independent panel report said Olympus Corp. "should remove its malignant cancer".
The panel detailed $1.7 billion of hidden losses from failed investments in the 1990s.
Report: "The management was rotten to the core, and infected those around it".
