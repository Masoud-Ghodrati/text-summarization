The first A350 XWB test flight comes to a successful end in Toulouse, France.
"I knew it was going to be impressive, but I was blown away," says Airbus COO.
The A350 is designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s.
There's still no confirmation of an A350 XWB appearance at Paris Air Show.
