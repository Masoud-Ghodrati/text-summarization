Roy Peter Clark: The Oxford English Dictionary has named "selfie" "Word of the Year".
He says word of year picks can sometimes be derided by word nerds.
He says selfies are fun, like photo booth picture strips; they are like "mini-me" pictures.
Clark: Word captures our culture: technologically forward looking, self-obsessed.
