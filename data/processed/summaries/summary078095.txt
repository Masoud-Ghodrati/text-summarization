NEW: Hamid Karzai again says any Kandahar offensive must have popular backing.
Karzai told tribal leaders he'd hold back NATO push until he got the leaders' OK.
Remarks by Afghan president "genuinely troubling," says White House spokesman.
U.S. commander was with Karzai when he made Sunday remarks to tribal leaders.
