CNN's Richard Quest hates public speaking, despite three decades in broadcasting.
He decided to face his fear through a RADA course on public speaking.
After so many years broadcasting Quest was skeptical he could learn much.
Quest was tactfully told he was too "full on" and "less is more" -- and he listened.
