Mark and Cindy Hill won half of a $587 million payout.
No big life changes yet: Mark still meets friends for coffee each day at a local convenience store..
Instead of large purchases, the Hills opted to give back to their local community.
Camden, MO, looks forward to a new firehouse, ball field and sewage treatment plant, courtesy of the Hills.
