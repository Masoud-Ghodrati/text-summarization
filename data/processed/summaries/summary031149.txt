NEW: At least 121 die and 45 are injured when an ammunition factory explodes, medical sources say.
The dead and wounded were ransacking the factory, security officials say.
The blast comes amid anti-government demonstrations and a fight against al Qaeda.
President Saleh says he's best equipped to fight the Islamists.
