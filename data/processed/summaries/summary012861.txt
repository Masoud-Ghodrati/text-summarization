The City Council of San Bernardino votes 5-2 to pursue bankruptcy filing.
The council declared a fiscal emergency, eliminating a 60-day mediation with creditors.
The vote does not mean the city does not intend to negotiate in good faith, an official says.
The city faces a $45 million shortfall as millions in revenues have evaporated.
