Sheri Piers, a pro runner, ran the Boston Marathon on Monday for her eighth time.
Piers says we can't let this tragedy taint the marathon or let whoever did it win.
Piers feels no sense of accomplishment; she says most runners want to forget race.
Piers will run the Boston race again but will always remember what happened.
