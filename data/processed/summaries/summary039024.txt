Wendy Shalit says recent articles spin evolutionary theories to justify infidelity.
One says men more likely to cheat on breadwinner wives, but also on low-earning wives.
Another claims men "hardwired" to cheat, she says; a third says infidelity natural, as with apes.
Shalit: Infidelity "science" a convenient excuse; men's better selves have self-control.
