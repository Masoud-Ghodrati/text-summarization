NEW: The Egyptian Rebels Coalition blames "interference from outside" for the violence.
Egypt's prime minister says the clashes "brought us back," forces are "scrambling".
The army says 12 troops died; a Coptic leader says 17 civilians died; one official says 23 total.
An emergency meeting with army and Coptic leaders will be Monday, an official says.
