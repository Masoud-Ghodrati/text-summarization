Unpredictable and capricious, Australia's bush fires are an erratic phenomenon.
Australia's science unit CSIRO says bush fires are unique in their ability to throw 'spot fires'.
Spot fires can sometimes flare up as far as 30km away from the main fire front.
Escaped fires are fires that flare up again once the original blaze was thought to have been extinguished.
