Although no strangers to North Korean hostility, Seoul residents see this attack as different.
The sight of columns of smoke rising from an artillery strike sent a frisson of real fear.
It was the first such attack since the Korean War ended at midnight July 27, 1953.
Seoul itself lies in range of massed, long-range North Korean artillery.
