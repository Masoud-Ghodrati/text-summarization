Kenya says Michael Adebolajo was arrested in 2010 and handed over to British officials.
Kenyan police detained him and six others suspected of links to Al-Shabaab, an official says.
Authorities are looking into Adebolajo's travels to east Africa.
Six arrests have been made in connection with a British soldier's killing, police say.
