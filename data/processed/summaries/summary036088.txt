Larry Zeiger moved from Brooklyn to Miami in 1957 in pursuit of a radio hosting gig.
Zeiger became Larry King when his first boss called his name "too ethnic".
Larry recalls being unable to speak his first time on-air.
He quickly overcame his first-day jitters and has felt at home on the air ever since.
