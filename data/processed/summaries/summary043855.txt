Images of Edinburgh's Giles Street on Google Street View appear to show an axe murder.
But mechanics Dan Thompson and Gary Kerr say they staged the "murder" for a laugh.
Thompson said he spotted the car coming and grabbed Kerr in time to set-up the tableau.
He said that the image was spotted by a supplier and police later visited to investigate.
