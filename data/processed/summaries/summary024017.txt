After months of debates and rallies Iowa is the first state where people actually get to vote for a candidate.
The state holds caucuses where communities debate each candidate's merits before voting, sometimes with a show of hands.
Iowa's status as first to vote means it is watched closely although it does not always pick the eventual winner.
Its issues are sometimes different to the nation -- so far Iowa has been spared the worst of the economic downturn.
