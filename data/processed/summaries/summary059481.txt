Obada Mzaik, a dual American and Syrian citizen, went missing on January 3.
The 21-year-old student was born in Columbus, Ohio; he was in Syria with his brother.
He is at least the second American citizen to have gone missing in Syria this month.
Mzaik's family back in the United States is now fearing the worst.
