Singer Phil Collins says he believes that he may have lived past lives.
His time is now spent working on his gigantic collection of artifacts from the Alamo.
Neck injury has left him unable to hold drum sticks, sign his signature.
"I wouldn't blow my head off," Collins says. "I'd overdose or do something".
