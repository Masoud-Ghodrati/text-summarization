NEW: Florida calls off state of emergency for several peninsula coastal counties.
Crews in the Gulf are trying to remove three pieces of drill pipe from the sunken well.
The work was delayed by a chemical buildup that jammed the entryway to the well.
Once the drill pipe is removed, crew can move on to a permanent shutdown of the well.
