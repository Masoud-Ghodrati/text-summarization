Former Bosnia Serb Gen. Ratko Mladic could have a war crimes indictment split in two.
One indictment would focus on the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.
The other indictment would focus on the shelling of Sarajevo and taking U.N. staff hostage.
Prosecutors want to begin the trial as soon as possible; Mladic says he is "gravely ill".
