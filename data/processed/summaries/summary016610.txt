France striker Thierry Henry will not be punished for his handball in November's World Cup play-off against Ireland.
FIFA''s disciplinary committee concluded there was "no legal foundation" for them to deal with the case.
Henry's handball in the run-up to William Gallas' decisive goal ended Irish hopes of reaching the World Cup finals.
