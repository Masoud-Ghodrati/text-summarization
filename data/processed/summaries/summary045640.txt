A U.S. marshal recalls the capture of Eric Frein at an abandoned Pennsylvania airport.
He first saw movement in high grass, after which he and others approached Frein.
Frein cut his face while face-first on asphalt; "we're not playing around," marshal say.
The marshal downplays the danger, saying it's "our job" to "hunt fugitives" like Frein.
