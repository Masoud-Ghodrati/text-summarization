British newspaper says Argentinian claims to the Falkland Islands are unfounded.
The Sun's open letter, saying "hands off" the islands, is printed in a Buenos Aires paper.
It's a response to an open letter from Argentina's president in UK media claiming sovereignty.
The British government says there won't be sovereignty talks unless islanders want them.
