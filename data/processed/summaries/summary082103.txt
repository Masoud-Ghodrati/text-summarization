Total's Elgin platform in the North Sea began leaking gas on Sunday.
Currently, about 200,000 cubic meters of gas a day are leaking into the water.
Two methods are being tried to stop it: drilling relief wells and plugging it up.
A Scottish official says the environmental risk appears to be minimal.
