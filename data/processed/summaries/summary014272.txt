North Koreans head to polls on March 9 to vote for deputies in the Supreme People's Assembly.
Critics say the poll is merely a political show to legitimize the country's rubber stamp parliament.
In previous elections in 2009, Kim Jong-il was returned with 100% of the vote.
Vote is of interest to Pyongyang watchers keen to know the composition of the ruling party.
