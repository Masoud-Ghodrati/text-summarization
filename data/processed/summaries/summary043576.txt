The NYPD's Demographics Unit was put together with the CIA's help.
The unit's reports never led to a terrorism investigation in at least 6 years of monitoring.
Thomas P. Galati's testimony was part of a suit that began with class-action case in 1971.
NYPD says "premise that the demographic unit was used for wholesale spying.. was false".
