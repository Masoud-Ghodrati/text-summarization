Pope Francis addressed the Vatican bureaucracy -- or Curia -- on Monday.
He launched a blistering attack on the "illnesses" within its members.
Francis warned against "vainglory," superiority and loss of compassion.
He referred to the diseases of excessive planning and of "the terrorism of gossip".
