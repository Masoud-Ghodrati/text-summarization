"I just need you to help me get my rest," Michael Jackson tells anesthesiologist.
Anesthesiologist David Adams offered to go on tour with Michael Jackson for $100,000 a month.
Jackson's offer to Dr. David Adams made Dr. Murray "truly upset," Adams says.
Murray "presented himself as being Mr. Jackson's personal physician and spokesperson" in 2007.
