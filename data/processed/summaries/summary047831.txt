Khairullozhon Matanov is charged with destroying evidence in Boston blasts.
He also faces three counts of making false statements to investigators.
Defense lawyer Edward Hayden says indictment was based on "unsubstantiated allegations".
He is not charged with the bombings, but with trying to hide ties to the Tsarnaev brothers.
