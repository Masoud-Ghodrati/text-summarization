Report into MH17's crash says everything -- but nothing about the criminals behind its downing.
CNN's Richard Quest asks how it can explain the incident without using the word missile.
The report goes into great detail about the plane's flight over Ukraine, the bad weather, and the black box.
Quest says the report shows the plane was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.
