Bob Greene says he heard from friend, Jeff Zaslow, 2 weeks before his death in a car crash.
He says writer Zaslow's integrity, both personal and professional, was inspiring.
He once drove hundreds of miles for a story that he easily could have "phoned in".
Greene: Over and over in his life, he took extra steps to get it right -- a lesson for us all.
