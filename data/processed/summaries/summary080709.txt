Prime Minister Enrico Letta handily wins a confidence vote in the Italian Senate.
He is also expected to win a confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament.
Silvio Berlusconi drops a bid to topple the government, says his party backs Letta.
Berlusconi could lose his Senate seat after a conviction for tax fraud was upheld.
