Libya let the FBI interview Faraj al-Shibli face to face, a Libyan source says.
He was detained in the last two days after returning from Pakistan, a source says.
Authorities don't know his involvement in the attack that left 4 Americans dead.
Libya's government issued an Interpol "Red Notice" seeking al-Shibli's arrest in 2004.
