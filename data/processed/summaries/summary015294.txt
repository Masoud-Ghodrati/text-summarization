The latest nuclear talks between Iran and the 5+1 countries failed to reach a deal.
Alex Vatanka says the November 24 deadline for an agreement is unlikely to be met.
Issues are the size of Iran's nuclear program, timetable for sanctions removals, he says.
Neither side wants to walk away, so the deadline must be extended, Vatanka says.
