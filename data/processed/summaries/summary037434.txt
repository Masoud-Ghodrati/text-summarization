Australia has struck a deal with Cambodia to settle refugees in the southeast Asian nation.
In return, Australia will contribute millions of dollars in additional aid.
The plan has been slammed by advocate groups who say Cambodia is ill-equipped to host.
They say the refugees will lead endangered lives on the margins of society in Cambodia.
