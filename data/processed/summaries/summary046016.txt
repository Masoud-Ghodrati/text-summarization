Richard White, 49, of San Diego, California, was hiking alone when the bear killed him.
Photos taken by the backpacker just before the attack show "nothing graphic," a park spokeswoman says.
"We're not sure what happened after the camera was put down," she says.
State troopers and rangers killed the bear Saturday.
