Cameron Todd Willingham was executed in Texas in 2004.
His family has asked the state parole board for a posthumous pardon.
Fire experts have said there was no evidence he set the fire that killed his daughters.
Prosecutors have insisted on his guilt, and Gov. Rick Perry has called him a "monster".
