Iranian forces that seized Iraqi oil well withdraw from facility but remain in Iraq, says Iraqi official.
Iran, however, dismissed Iraq's allegations of takeover, saying well is in Iranian territory.
Negotiations to resolve diplomatic standoff are ongoing, says Iraq's Deputy Foreign Minister.
The two countries fought 8-year war that ended in 1988 with parts of border under dispute.
