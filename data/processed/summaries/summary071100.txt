Archaeologists working for London's Crossrail project find 13 skeletons in 2 neat rows.
They are thought to have been buried in the mid-14th century amid a plague outbreak.
The area excavated in central London has lain undisturbed for centuries.
Plague bacteria are still carried by some rodents and the fleas that live on them.
