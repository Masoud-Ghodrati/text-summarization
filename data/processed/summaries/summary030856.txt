Ivan Ljubicic retires from professional tennis after a stellar career which included 10 titles.
The 33-year-old was also part of Croatian Davis Cup team which beat Slovakia in 2005.
Says Djokovic displayed mental strengths as a youngster but was not the best technically.
Ljubicic claimed ATP Indian Wells Masters title at the age of 31 in 2010.
