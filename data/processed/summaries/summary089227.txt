The museum and memorial are at the World Trade Center site.
The memorial opened last year, but a budget dispute halted work on the museum.
New York City's mayor and the state's governor say the dispute has been resolved.
Mayor Bloomberg says work will resume soon "and will not stop until the museum is completed".
