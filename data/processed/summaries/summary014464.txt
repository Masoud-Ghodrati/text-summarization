Former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba is reported to be earning $300,000 a week in China.
Drogba says he has not made the move to retire, and wants to be a champion.
Critics describe the luring of top players to China as vanity projects.
"The most important thing is that I come here to help Chinese football," Drogba said.
