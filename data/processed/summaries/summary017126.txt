Nearly two years after he killed Trayvon Martin, George Zimmerman speaks to CNN.
He says he hopes to become an attorney "to stop the miscarriage of justice".
With paintings, Zimmerman says he's hoping to "provide a decent lifestyle" for his family.
"I don't watch news anymore," he says when asked about Michael Dunn's case.
