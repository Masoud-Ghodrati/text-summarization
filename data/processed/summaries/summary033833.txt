The Victoria Falls are located on the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia.
The World Travel & Tourism Council expects tourism to make more money for Zimbabwe in 2014 than any other year in the past decade.
Between 1999 and 2005 the tourism sector in Zimbabwe shrunk significantly.
Renewed confidence in tourism in Zimbabwe is partially due to a $150 million plan to expand the airport at Victoria Falls.
