Police are investigating assault and arson they're calling a "hate crime" in Lincoln, Nebraska.
The victim, 33, has words carved into her skin and painted on her walls, an officer says.
A neighbor says the woman came to her door in the middle of the night, naked and bleeding.
The woman is openly lesbian and "the best neighbor," a friend says.
