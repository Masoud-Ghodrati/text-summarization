NEW: Ratko Mladic declines to answer questions on Srebrenica massacre, Sarajevo siege.
Mladic says U.N.-backed court is "satanic," argues testimony could harm his own case.
He is called as a defense witness in the trial of ex-Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic.
Both men are being tried on charges of genocide and other war crimes during the 1990s.
