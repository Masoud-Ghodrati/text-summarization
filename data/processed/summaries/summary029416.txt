Users have complained some magazine apps look pixilated, or blurry, on the new iPad.
With the iPad 3, publishers are now dealing with a device with four times as many pixels.
Publishers will have to increase the resolution of their files and export their editions as PDFs.
An exception is Vogue, which was able to optimize for the iPad's "retina display" ahead of time.
