Prince George christened in small, private event at St. James's Palace.
George wore an ornate christening gown that's a replica of an 1841 royal original.
7 people are named as godparents, including childhood friends of William and Kate.
"All babies are unbelievably special, not only royal babies," says Archbishop of Canterbury.
