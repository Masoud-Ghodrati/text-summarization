High court judge rules that Oscar Pistorius' murder trial can be televised in part.
Pistorius goes on trial on Monday, accused in the death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.
Judge says TV cameras won't be allowed to film testimony of Pistorius and defense witnesses.
But he allows live audio recording of the entire trial and televising of some parts.
