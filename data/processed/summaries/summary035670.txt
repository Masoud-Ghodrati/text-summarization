Court of Arbitration for Sport overturns ruling by the Spanish Cycling Federation.
Appeal body says Alberto Contador likely consumed contaminated food supplement.
The Spaniard has been banned retroactively for two years, ending in August 2012.
He has also been stripped of his 2010 Tour de France title and all his 2011 victories.
