NEW: It took five days for parole officials to realize Evan Ebel fled, records show.
Apology not enough for Ebel release, victim's relatives tell CNN affiliate KUSA.
Ebel is suspected of killing Colorado prisons chief Tom Clements.
He was let go four years early; court didn't fully explain sentence to prison.
