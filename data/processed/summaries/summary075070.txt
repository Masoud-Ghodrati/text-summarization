NEW: Two drivers had a "brief exchange" before one opened fire, arrest warrant says.
Police say Ammar Harris, 26, fired at a Maserati, which then crashed into a taxi in Las Vegas.
Facing 11 charges, Harris is arrested "without incident" in Los Angeles, police say.
Three others in his Range Rover with Harris "are not suspects," a police lieutenant says.
