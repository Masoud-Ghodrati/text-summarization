NEW: Four other sons are either hiding or have run away, El Gamaty says.
The arrest of Mohammed Gadhafi plays out as the son is on the phone with a news network.
Heavy gunfire can be heard and the phone call abruptly ends.
The International Criminal Court said it will seek to transfer Saif al-Islam Gadhafi into its custody.
