Jesse Osmun, 33, of Connecticut worked at a center for orphans in South Africa.
While there, he engaged in sexual acts with four girls, all under the age of 6, officials say.
When confronted with the allegations, Osmun confessed, his attorney says.
The Peace Corps has donated to a fund that Osmun's family set up to help his victims.
