Cuban author Pedro Juan Gutierrez  says he is interested in the ethics of the poorest.
His observations are harsh; some say he is pornographic, but he has also won acclaim.
He says that "reality is excessive. I have to tone things down to make it believable".
He worked as a journalist at state-run newspapers, but his fiction got him fired.
