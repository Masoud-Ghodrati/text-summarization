The FBI is conducting a criminal investigation that may affect the 9/11 trial, lawyers said.
Defense lawyers for Ramzi bin al Shibh said the FBI asked a team member to be an informant.
The defense said the inquiry could be a conflict of interest; Justice lawyers disagree.
Bin al Shibh, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and 3 others will be tried in Guantanamo Bay.
