London's "Boxpark" shopping mall has been built from 60 shipping containers.
Park's founder says mall offers sustainable alternative to conventional retail outlets.
Mall's shops can relocate to another part of the country if business is slow.
Recycled containers save "embodied" carbon cost linked to construction of new buildings.
