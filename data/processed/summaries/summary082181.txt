Gary Vincent Giordano, 51, and a woman are charged with indecent exposure in Maryland.
Police charge the couple after receiving a call about possible sexual activity in an SUV.
Giordano "completely nude" in SUV parked in Annapolis garage, police said.
Giordano was held last year in Aruba in the disappearance of a woman traveling with him.
