Japan's Twin Ring Motegi circuit will not host an IndyCar race in 2012.
It has been dropped from the calendar as organizers seek to maximize viewing audience.
Sao Paulo in Brazil will be the only international event in the series next year.
Motegi owner says it was struggling to afford to stage the race in tough economic times.
