Todd Graham: Rick Perry forgot what he was going to say in the middle of a debate answer.
He says as debate gaffes go, this one was a whopper that will be hard for voters to forget.
He says for many, it confirmed low expectations about Perry's grasp of issues.
Graham: Since voters have other GOP choices besides Perry, this mistake may be fatal.
