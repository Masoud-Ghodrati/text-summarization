Raymond Davis is charged with misdemeanor assault, a sheriff's official says.
Davis is accused of getting into a fistfight over a parking spot at a mall, the official says.
Davis was arrested in January on charges he killed two men in Lahore, Pakistan.
U.S. officials originally said Davis was a diplomat, but later revealed he was a CIA contractor.
