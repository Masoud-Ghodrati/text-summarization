Clashes break out as guards work to stop a "massive prison break," officials say.
11 inmates and 6 guards are killed, Durango public safety officials report.
Violence has been reported at the prison in the past.
In 2010, prosecutors said prison authorities let out inmates so they could kill gang rivals.
