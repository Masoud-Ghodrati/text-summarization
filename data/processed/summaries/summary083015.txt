Avonte Oquendo, 14, has been missing since he ran out of his school a week ago.
"He cannot fend for himself out there," says his mother, Vanessa Fontaine.
An anonymous $50,000 donation for the reward came in Friday through Autism Speaks.
The family takes the first step toward filing a lawsuit against the city, an attorney says.
