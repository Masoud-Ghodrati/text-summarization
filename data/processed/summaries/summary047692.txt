Top editors of the University of Georgia's student paper quit and the staff walked out.
They said the paper's board hired staff with "veto power" over them on news content.
The board now says students have editorial control and makes student-backed changes.
A board vice chair says a "big misunderstanding" became "a feeding frenzy for the media".
