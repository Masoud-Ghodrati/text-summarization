28 people died in an attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport, Pakistan's military says.
Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) says the attack was revenge for the killing of its leader.
TTP leader Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike in November 2013.
Imtiaz Gul says the TTP appears to be trying to hurt Pakistan's economic interests, isolate it.
