Most-capped player in history,  Ahmed Hassan, says Egypt is suffering from a lack of ethics.
Former Egypt captain blames "over-confidence" for team's failure to qualify for 2012 ACN.
He was deeply moved by the fatal football riots in Port Said on February 1.
Hassan says the activities of "ultras" can cause problems in the stadiums.
