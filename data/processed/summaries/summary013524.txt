The Philippines has the longest Christmas season in the world -- from September to January.
The festive season is marked by traditional masses, spectacular light displays and family gatherings.
Traditional paper and bamboo lanterns known as 'parols' light up many Filipino villages and towns.
Some villages organise contents for the best Christmas decorations.
