Five magazine staffers in Myanmar have been sentenced to a decade of hard labor.
Observers say it marks a return to old ways following a couple of years of promising reforms.
The sentences have been criticized around the world as "outrageously harsh".
The magazine, since shuttered, had run stories about the production of chemical weapons.
