Nokia is offering to pay developers to make apps for its new phone, sources say.
Such payments from phone manufacturers are unusual.
Microsoft did something similar last year, but its Windows Phone app catalog is still lacking.
Nokia is set to launch its first Windows phone by the end of the year, sources say.
