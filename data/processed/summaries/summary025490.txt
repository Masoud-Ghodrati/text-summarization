Royal Caribbean says Quantum of the Seas is the world's most technologically advanced cruise ship.
Ship highlights include a skydiving simulator, bumper cars and a glass pod that rises more than 300 feet in the air.
Passengers in interior staterooms get virtual balconies, which offer real-time views of the ocean.
Quantum will spend the winter cruising the eastern Caribbean before moving to Shanghai next June.
