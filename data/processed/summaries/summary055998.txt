Queen Elizabeth II is visiting Enniskillen, scene of a deadly IRA bombing 25 years ago.
She is to meet former IRA commander Martin McGuinness Wednesday.
McGuinness is now a Sinn Fein politician and the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland.
The queen lost a relative, Lord Mountbatten, to an IRA bomb in 1979.
