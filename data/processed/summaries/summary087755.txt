Immigration reform bill could be sunk by amendments from left and right, says Ruben Navarrette.
He says reform died in 2007 after a "poison pill" amendment by Democratic senator.
Ted Cruz and Patrick Leahy have introduced amendments that could doom bill, he says.
Navarrette: Leahy amendment on gay couples will energize opponents of immigration reform.
