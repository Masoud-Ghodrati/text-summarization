The Michigan High School Athletic Association OKs a waiver provision.
The waiver allows 19-year-olds to play sports under narrow circumstances.
Eric Dompierre, 19, who has Down syndrome, can now seek a waiver to play ball next fall.
Only 701 of the association's 1,535 schools participated in the waiver vote, but 94% OK it.
