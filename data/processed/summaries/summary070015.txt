An explosion rocked government offices in central Oslo on Friday afternoon.
Police say the suspect in that blast then headed 20 miles to Utoya Island.
There he gunned down at least 86 people, in addition to 7 killed by the bomb.
The 32-year-old man didn't put up a fight when he was arrested, police say.
