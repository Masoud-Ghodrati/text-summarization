Skiing sensation Lindsey Vonn is considering legal action in her bid to race men.
The 28-year-old American is the second most successful female skier of all time.
Skiing's governing body rejected her request to take on the men at Lake Louise.
Vonn has four Alpine Skiing World Cup titles to her name and an Olympic gold medal.
