Mubarak wins petition for release but will remain detained on other cases, state TV says.
A day after a judge recused himself from a retrial, Mubarak's lawyers asked for release.
The former Egyptian president faces charges involving the killing of protesters.
He was driven from office in 2011 and found guilty in the slayings in 2012.
