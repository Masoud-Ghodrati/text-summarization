Fencer Alison Yu Chui Yee has seven Paralympic gold medals to her name.
The 28-year-old from Hong Kong had part of her leg amputated when she was 11.
Yu says she forgot to strike a signature pose after winning gold in London.
Yu: "I think the most important thing for your life, is the way you interpret things".
