NEW: Iran's president slams the U.S. in a speech marking the Islamic Revolution.
Last week, a navy official reportedly said warships were headed to U.S. maritime borders.
A U.S. official said there was no operational information to support that claim.
The latest Iranian claim came a day before the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
