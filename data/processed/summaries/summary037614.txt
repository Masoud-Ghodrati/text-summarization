As a former hostage negotiator, George Kohlrieser has been held hostage four times.
He says hostage negotiators are successful because they build trust through dialogue.
Today, Kohlrieser works mostly with corporate leaders instead of hostage takers.
He says building a "secure base" to employees is essential for good leadership.
