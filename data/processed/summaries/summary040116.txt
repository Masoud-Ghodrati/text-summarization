Barry and Grace Kolman taught their daughter clarinet to help her cope with bullying.
Mano, who has autism, started playing in her middle school band last fall.
Her parents say it's given her a social outlet and a way to express her feelings.
They hope to publish a book so other children with autism can benefit from music.
