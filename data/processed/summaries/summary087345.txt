David Perry: Pope Celestine V, from 1296, and Pope Benedict XVI both resigned.
He says Benedict likely turned to example of Celestine, who codified pope's right to resign.
Does Celestine's reference to "malignity" of people find echo in Benedict's resignation letter?.
Perry: Some guess pope is fleeing scandal-plagued church; others think he seeks tranquility.
