King Juan Carlos has announced he is abdicating after almost four decades on Spain's throne.
It follows the 2013 abdications of Belgium's Albert II and the Netherlands' Queen Beatrix.
Victoria Arbiter says Queen Elizabeth II swore on her 21st birthday to serve her whole life.
Britain's Queen, Arbiter says, would only step down were she incapacitated.
