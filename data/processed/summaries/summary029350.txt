Stephanie Roche is off to America to play for Houston Dash in the U.S. Woman's National Football League.
The Irish international striker scored a stunning goal which was nominated for the FIFA Puskas Award.
Roche's goal came second to James Rodriguez' strike for Colombia against Uruguay at the World Cup last year.
The 25-year-old's move to the U.S. follows a brief stint with French club ASPTT Albi.
