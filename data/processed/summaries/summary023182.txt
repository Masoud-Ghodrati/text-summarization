"New Day" Digital Producer Jessica Moskowitz was diagnosed with a brain tumor in September.
Moskowitz, then 28, was at work when she began to feel strange symptoms and was rushed to the hospital.
After surgery and ongoing rehabilitation, she says, she gained an appreciation for life she'd never had.
