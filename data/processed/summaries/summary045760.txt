Secretary of State John Kerry hails France as the United States' "oldest ally".
Britain, which touts its "special relationship" with the U.S., won't join military action in Syria.
Paris and Washington have not always seen eye-to-eye, notably on the 2003 Iraq invasion.
France also declined to support U.S. strikes on Libya under Reagan in 1986.
