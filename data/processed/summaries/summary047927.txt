Sentencing hearing begins for three former Atlanta police officers.
Kathryn Johnston, 92, killed in her home during botched drug raid in November 2006.
The officers pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights.
Officers "regularly swore falsely" to get warrants, assistant U.S. attorney says.
