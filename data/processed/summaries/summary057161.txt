American Airlines sends letter for its union saying pilots are hurting the company.
The letter threatens court action and discipline against those pilots implicated.
A union rep says this doesn't help talks and will "further ... enrage" pilots.
American won bankruptcy court approval to throw out the pilots' labor deal.
