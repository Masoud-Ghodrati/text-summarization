Thursday night's debate was the Joe Biden show, says debate coach Todd Graham.
For the first half, the vice president was at his best, Graham says.
Biden's strength was his approach to middle class and senior citizens, he says.
Graham: For much of the second half though, Biden seemed out of control.
