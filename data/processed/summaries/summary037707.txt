Bob Greene: J.K. Rowling used pseudonym to publish book that didn't sell, but critics liked.
She was outed as author, sales of the book soared.
Greene: If publisher hadn't known it was Rowling, it would have been a more telling tale.
He says once an unknown author retyped a famous novel; no publisher would take it.
