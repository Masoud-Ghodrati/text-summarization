With a kidnapping reported, authorities in Bulgaria searched for an American named Kate.
But there was no kidnapping, and there was no Kate, U.S. authorities say.
New Jersey man tells authorities he created "Kate" online and claimed she was kidnapped.
Just a joke, says the man, now charged with making false statements to a U.S. official.
