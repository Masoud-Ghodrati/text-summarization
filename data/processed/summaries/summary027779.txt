German Chancellor Angela Merkel, heading into her third term, is the antithesis of a modern-day politician.
She is modest and unassuming, and fondly called Mutti -- or mother -- by the German public.
She is often compared the "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher, but her style is quiet different.
But it would be naive to assume Merkel wasn't as much of a political animal as her peers.
