"The Giver" is based on Lois Lowry's 1993 Newberry Medal-winning novel.
The film, which opened over the weekend, partners conservatives and liberals.
Conservatives like the message of the consequences of government overreach.
Liberal producer Harvey Weinstein says the film was made "without a political agenda".
