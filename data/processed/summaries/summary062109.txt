Archdiocese says it has "accepted responsibility" for misconduct of former priest Michael Baker.
Four men allege they were molested as boys by Baker dating back to the 1970s.
The four men sue the Los Angeles Archdiocese and Cardinal Roger Mahony.
Mahony is in Rome as part of the cardinals' conclave voting for a new pope.
