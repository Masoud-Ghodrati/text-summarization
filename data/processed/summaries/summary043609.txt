Fabrice Muamba receives standing ovation as he returns to White Hart Lane for first time.
Muamba collapsed at the London soccer stadium during a match in March.
His heart stopped for 78 minutes, but he was saved by a cardiologist from the crowd.
Muamba is raising awareness for heart problems since being forced to retire.
