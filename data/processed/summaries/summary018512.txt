Ex-New York City Mayor Ed Koch, 88, died Friday, sparking waves of online tributes.
@mayoredkoch Twitter account features touching retweets.
NEW: John Avlon: In the end he was "almost impossible to dislike" which "reflected the city.".
Younger Americans may remember Koch best from TV's "People's Court".
