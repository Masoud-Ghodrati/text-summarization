Tennis will probably change one of its anti-doping rules in 2014 following Viktor Troicki's ban.
Troicki received an 18-month suspension after failing to provide a blood sample in April.
Troicki claims he was told he could take the test the day after but the ITF refutes that.
Troicki says Novak Djokovic was among those who signed a petition demanding rule changes.
