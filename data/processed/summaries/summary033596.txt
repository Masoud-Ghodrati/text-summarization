ICE officers detained the mother and brother of activist Erika Andiola.
Her mother was on a bus to the Mexican border, when a call came to turn around.
Andiola advocates legislation to give children of undocumented immigrants access to legal status.
This was the first time Andiola had to get active on her own family's behalf.
