NEW: U.N. chemical weapon inspectors will investigate two 'confidential' locations in Syria.
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the death toll may rise.
The blast occurred in the Wadi Aldahab neighborhood in Homs, the group says.
It says the explosion happened after shells fell on pro-regime parts of the city.
