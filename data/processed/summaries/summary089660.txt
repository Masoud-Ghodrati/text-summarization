Start of the 33rd America's Cup has been delayed yet again by a lack of wind in Spain.
Holders Alinghi were due to face Oracle in first of three races on Monday morning.
It has now been rescheduled for Wednesday, with Alinghi seeking a third straight title.
The two syndicates have been in legal disputes since Alinghi's last win in 2007.
