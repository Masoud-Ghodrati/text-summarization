Bayern Munich's treble-winning coach Jupp Heynckes plans to take a break from football.
The 68-year-old will be replaced by former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola next season.
Bayern won the European Champions League, German championship and German Cup.
Heynckes had been hotly-tipped to fill the coaching vacancy at Real Madrid.
