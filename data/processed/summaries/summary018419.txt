Moammar Gadhafi came into a power in a bloodless coup against King Idris in 1969.
By 1972, he was urging Muslims to fight Western powers, including the U.K. and U.S..
Decades later, he appeared to moderate and seek rapprochement with the West.
The movement to unseat him began in February, centered first in Benghazi.
