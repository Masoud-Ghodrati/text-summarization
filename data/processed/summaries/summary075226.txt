Golfer Erik Compton will tee off as a fully-fledged PGA Tour member on Thursday.
Compton has already had two heart transplants but has still reached top of the sport.
He won the Mexico Open in 2011 to seal his lifelong dream of playing on the PGA Tour.
Compton says golf has helped keep him alive through his many years of health problems.
