ALS, a progressive disease, attacks brain neurons leading to total paralysis.
It affects 20,000 to 30,000 Americans at any one time but vets have twice the risk.
The VA listed ALS as a service-connected disease on September 23, 2008.
Retired vet Thomas Cuddy navigates VA bureaucracy as his disease progresses.
