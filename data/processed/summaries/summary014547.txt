Marisol Valles Garcia is police chief in a violent Mexican municipality.
A newspaper and a news service say she has fled to the U.S., seeking asylum.
Mexican authorities deny the reports and say she is on personal leave.
Valles Garcia was just 20 years old when she accepted the police chief's position.
