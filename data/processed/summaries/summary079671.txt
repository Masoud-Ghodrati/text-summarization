State report: Ariel Castro committed suicide, didn't die of auto-erotic asphyxiation.
A corrections officer saw Castro 27 minutes before the inmate was found hanging.
A note in Castro's cell says "all are sinners, we all fall short on the glory of God".
Another handwritten note says "love my kids and grandkids".
