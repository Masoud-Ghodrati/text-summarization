Ryan Braun suspended for the rest of the year by Major League Baseball.
Mike Downey says news of suspension comes in midst of a great season.
People want to focus on Mariano Rivera, Chris Davis, Yasiel Puig, Downey says.
Downey: Baseball's troubles with drugs are tiresome and distract from the game.
