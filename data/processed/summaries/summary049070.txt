Alaska has the highest men-to-women ratio in the country.
John Sutter says the ratio doesn't explain high rates of violence against women.
Alaska also has the nation's highest reported rape rate: three times the national average.
Sutter: There are 107 men for every 100 women in Alaska; difference isn't extreme.
