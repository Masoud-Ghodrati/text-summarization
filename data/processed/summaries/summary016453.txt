Australian Tony Sullivan married Richard Adams, a U.S. citizen, in 1975.
No country in the world recognized same-sex marriage then.
Sullivan overstayed his tourist visa and lived under the radar in order to be with his love.
One year after DOMA was struck down, Sullivan is trying again for permanent residence.
