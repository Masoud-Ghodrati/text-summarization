Woods' internationally known restaurant has drawn customers from all walks of life.
Sylvia's restaurant opened on Lenox Avenue in 1962.
"We lost a legend today," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says in a statement.
Woods' success led to the launch of a catering company and national food products line.
