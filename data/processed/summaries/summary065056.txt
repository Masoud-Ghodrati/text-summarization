Australian Penny Palfrey, 49, will try to swim from Havana, Cuba, to Florida Keys.
She will make attempt without a shark cage or swim aids such as flippers or a wetsuit.
A lycra suit will provide her some protection from jellyfish, her husband says.
A crew of 15, including medical personnel and meteorologists, will shadow her.
