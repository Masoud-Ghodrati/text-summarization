Howell Raines: Fox News has been contorting to deliver good news for Romney's campaign.
He says commentators' spin attributes Obama gains to media distortion, voter ignorance, etc..
Raines: Bill O'Reilly says evenhanded things for deniability if spin is wrong, Romney fails.
Raines: It will be interesting to see Fox spin if campaign should begin to reek of defeat.
