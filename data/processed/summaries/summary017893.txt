Uber says it hasn't been notified of the ban and continues to operate.
The city's traffic police say they will start implementing the ban on the car service.
The move follows the alleged rape of a woman by an Uber driver who is now in police custody.
The suspect in the case appeared in court Monday; Uber has called the incident "abhorrent".
