Aaron Carroll: Ryan's proposals for Medicare, Medicaid sharply differ from Obama's.
He says Ryan's Medicare plan could change quality of care, increase cost to seniors.
He says plan for block grants to states to pay for Medicaid would result in benefit cuts to poor, old.
Carroll: Obama's approach is different; ideally a compromise would keep best of both plans.
