Radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists.
Al-Masri was sentenced to life in prison by a federal judge in New York.
Judge Katherine Forrest tells al-Masri, "I don't believe the world would be safe with you in 10 years, 15 years or longer".
