Comedy site Funny or Die plans a spoof Steve Jobs biopic.
Feature-length movie stars Justin Long, the "I'm a Mac" guy from Apple ads.
Film's writer says he's an expert because he owns an iPhone and checked Wikipedia.
Spoof will be posted online April 15, as two major Steve Jobs films are on horizon.
