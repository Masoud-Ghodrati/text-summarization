Jay Parini: Trailer for new TV show "Black Jesus" drawing ire of conservative Christian group.
It shows guy who lives in California, says he's Jesus, is black, consorts with rough sorts.
Parini: Criticism seems misplaced; Jesus' image as man-of-people runs through Bible.
Parini: Jesus I know, love was something of a party animal. He can survive "Black Jesus".
