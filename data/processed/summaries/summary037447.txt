Photographer Don McCullin's exhibition "Shaped by War" opened in London Friday.
McCullin has photographed wars in Vietnam, Congo, Biafra and the Middle East for more than 30 years.
Today McCullin is more comfortable shooting landscapes and Roman ruins.
McCullin: I've got a last chapter of my life and I want it to be enjoyable.
