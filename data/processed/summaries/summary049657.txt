Detainee Majed Al-Majed died after his health deteriorated, Lebanon's army says.
The Saudi national was detained by the Lebanese army in the past few days.
He was the alleged head of an al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group, the Abdullah Azzam Brigades.
The group has claimed responsibility for attacks in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan.
