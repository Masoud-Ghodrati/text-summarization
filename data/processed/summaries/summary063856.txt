Caroline Wozniacki completes the New York Marathon in just over three hours, 26 minutes.
She was met at the finish line by one of her best pals, fellow tennis player Serena Williams.
Wozniacki ran for charity after saying it was on her "bucket list" to take part in the race.
Wozniacki was formerly engaged to the world's top-ranked golfer, Rory McIlroy.
