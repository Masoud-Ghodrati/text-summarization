Olympic swimmer Cullen Jones promotes water safety with theÂ Make a Splash Initiative.
According to Cullen, 70% of African Americans and 60% of Hispanics can't swim.
Fear, parental backing and physical appearance contribute to this lack of swim skills.
Parents should teach children how to swim and tell them never to swim alone.
