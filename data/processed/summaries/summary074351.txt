NEW: Gilbert Brule says it's "insane" that Bono said he wanted to be the hockey player.
Bono tells a concert crowd he was picked up while hitchhiking in Vancouver.
Brule, an Edmonton Oiler, and his girlfriend gave the U2 singer a ride.
Bono says: "I like ice hockey, because (players) are the kind of people who pick up hitchhikers".
