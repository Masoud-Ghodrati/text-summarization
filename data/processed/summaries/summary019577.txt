Crabs roamed after escaping their cages in the cargo of a plane at New York's LaGuardia airport.
U.S. Airways flight 890, bound for Charlotte, North Carolina, was delayed a half hour.
Airline spokesman says "a good number" of crabs were "running amok in the cargo hold".
Maintenance crews corralled the crustaceans.
