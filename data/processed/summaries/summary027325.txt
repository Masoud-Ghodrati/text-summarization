Jaylen Fryberg shot 5, killing 1, at his Washington high school before killing himself.
Fellow students express surprise, describing him as a well-liked and good person.
He was suspended after a fight, after "racist" words were directed at him, student says.
"I would have never expected it would have been him," another classmate says.
