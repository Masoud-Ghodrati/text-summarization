Omar McRoberts: Obama faces criticism from blacks and fears of commitment to Christianity.
FDR also faced religious challenges, criticism from African-Americans, he writes.
He says Roosevelt enlisted black church to build up trust among a disenfranchised group.
Obama could turn to black churches to bring out vote and prove religious identity, he says.
