South Africa's ostrich industry is facing tough times after a major bird flu outbreak.
More than 40,000 ostriches have been culled since last April.
Officials warn that the impact of the disease outbreak on the industry is severe.
South Africa accounts for up to 80% of the world's ostrich products.
