Steve Jobs lived by a set of values that shaped everything he did, Pete Cashmore writes.
Jobs, despite his financial success, was frugal.
Jobs questioned authority his entire life, even choosing to drive without license plates.
He saw death as having positive aspects, referring to it as "nature's change agent".
