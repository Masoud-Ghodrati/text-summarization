Jail guard says James Lunn was hanging by shoelaces and belt from a bathroom door.
Prosecutor orders probe to determine if the death was a suicide.
Lunn was arrested in August after a car bomb exploded near a northern Sinai police station.
Lunn had "a computer and maps of vital installations" when arrested, official says.
