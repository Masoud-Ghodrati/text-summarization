An outbreak of the Ebola virus in West Africa has killed more than 4,400 people since March.
Campaigner and musician Bob Geldof says immediate action is needed to stop the crisis.
Geldof says Ebola's spread is linked to poverty in the worst affected countries.
He warns affected states could collapse, allowing Ebola and "human evils" to take hold.
