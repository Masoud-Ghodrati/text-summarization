A Chinese spacecraft, Chang'e-3, is due to land on the moon this weekend.
Chang'e-3 will release a moon rover to collect soil samples and study the lunar surface.
The solar-powered robot contains a telescope and ultraviolet camera.
China is one of three countries to make a soft-landing on the moon.
