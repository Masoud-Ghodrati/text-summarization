Millions are expected to join in "Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day".
This is the 21st year for the annual event that asks parents take their children to work.
For many parents, the challenge is how to make the day fun and meaningful.
"You don't bring a child there to babysit," a spokesman for the organizers said.
