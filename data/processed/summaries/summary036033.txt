A South Korean man is presented to foreign journalists in Pyongyang.
He says he is a missionary and carried out "anti-state" activities for South Korean intelligence.
The south's intelligence agency says it has nothing to do with the case.
South Korea calls for the man to be released "as soon as possible".
