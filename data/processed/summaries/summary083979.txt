Italy's art models have gone on strike, demanding they get a full-time wage.
Around 300 people do the job, but only about 50 of them are full-time.
During the Italian Renaissance artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models.
Priests let prostitutes use churches so it was possible to attract, employ name artists.
