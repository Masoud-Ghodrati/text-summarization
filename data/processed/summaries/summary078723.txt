John Terry's role as England soccer captain in jeopardy due to his alleged marital infidelity.
UK government minister says Terry may be stripped of role if tabloid claims are true.
Terry failed in court injunction to stop reporting of affair with teammate's ex-partner.
The 29-year-old has two children with his wife and won a parenting award in 2009.
