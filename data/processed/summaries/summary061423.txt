NEW: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon says charges against Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir are very serious.
He faces charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide over Darfur.
He is visiting the African nation of Chad, which is a party to the court.
The UN estimates that 300,000 people died in the Darfur conflict, and 2.5 million fled their homes.
