John Avlon: NRA has an "enemies list" of 500 organizations, leaders, celebs.
Avlon: List is absurd, includes Spinal Cord Injury Association, Britney Spears, YMCA.
List shows how extreme, fanatical and out of touch the NRA has become, he says.
Avlon: NRA's cultlike insistence on ideological purity puts off people it wants to reach.
