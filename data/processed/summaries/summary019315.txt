Former U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown, now a U.N. envoy, says children deserve justice.
Brown says there are 500 days left to fulfill Millennium goals and we're falling short.
Much needs to be done to make promise of universal education meaningful, he says.
Brown: Young people are demanding their rights and will be heard.
