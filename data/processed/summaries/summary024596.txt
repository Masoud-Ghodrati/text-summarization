Gilberton Police Chief Mark Kessler is an outspoken gun rights advocate.
In a video posted to YouTube, he rails against liberals working to curb gun rights.
The town's city council is taking up the issue at a meeting next week, the mayor says.
Kessler tells a CNN affiliate that he wasn't in uniform and was exercising his rights.
