Brian Cahill became a suicide prevention trainer after his son, a police officer, killed himself.
About 145 cops commit suicide a year, he says. Thousands have PTSD and depression.
Cahill: Cops see traumatic stuff every day. What helps them on the job can harm them at home.
Cahill: Police departments need to teach officers to recognize trauma and provide help.
