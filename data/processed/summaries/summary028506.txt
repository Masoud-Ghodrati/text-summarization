Russ Berkman says his dog ate four Masters tickets he'd gotten months ago.
The dog threw up the tickets, and Berkman then pieced them together.
Authorities at Augusta National heard his tale, allowed him to attend event.
His dog is "happy ... and completely oblivious to the fact that she's famous".
