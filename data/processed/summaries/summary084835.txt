Colombia faces hosts Brazil on Friday in its first ever World Cup quarterfinal.
Match comes 20 years after the murder of Colombian defender Andres Escobar.
Escobar was gunned down days after Colombia had exited the 1994 World Cup.
The 27-year-old had scored an own goal in a defeat to the USA during the competition.
