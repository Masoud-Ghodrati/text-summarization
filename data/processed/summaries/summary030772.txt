The U.N. high commissioner for refugees meets with top Iraqi officials.
He proposes a plan of action to create conditions that will allow refugees to return home.
U.N. says there are 196,000 Iraqi refugees in other countries, 1.3 million internally displaced.
Iraq's new government "represents an enormous opportunity," UNHCR says.
