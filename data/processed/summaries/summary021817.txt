An appeals court invalidates two of Casey Anthony's convictions, upholds two others.
She was convicted of four counts of lying to authorities during an investigation.
The investigation was into the disappearance of Anthony's 2-year-old daughter, Caylee.
Anthony's attorney said his client wants to "keep fighting" after hearing about ruling.
