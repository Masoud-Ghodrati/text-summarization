Prosecutors allege Ladislaus Csizsik-Csatary was "actively involved in" deporting Jews.
Nearly 12,000 Jews were sent from Kosice to German concentration camps in 1944.
Csizsik-Csatary was commander of the deportation camp, prosecutors say.
He tops the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of "most wanted Nazi war criminals".
