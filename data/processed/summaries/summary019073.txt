Egypt's former president is accused of ordering protesters shot.
The crime carries the death penalty, and courts will not hesitate to use it, Egypt's justice minister says.
Hosni Mubarak is in good health, the minister says.
Mubarak was forced from office by protesters after more than 30 years in power.
