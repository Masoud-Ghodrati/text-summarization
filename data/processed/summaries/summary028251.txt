Police say the captives were brainwashed, emotionally abused.
A couple is alleged to have held three women captive in London for more than 30 years.
One of the alleged captives contacted a charity, which worked with police on a rescue.
Police arrested the pair Thursday but released them on bail Friday, until a date in January.
