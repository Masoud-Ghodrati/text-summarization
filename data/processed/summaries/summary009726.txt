On April 14, Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 girls from a school in Chibok, Nigeria.
A CNN team made the dangerous journey to the village in Boko Haram's heartland.
CNN correspondent Nima Elbagir spoke to a girl who fled, mothers of abductees and other villagers.
She accompanied villagers armed with machetes on their night-time patrol of the area.
