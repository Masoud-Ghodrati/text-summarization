Ruta Meilutyte says getting out of bed is difficult but she does it because she loves swimming.
As a 15-year-old in 2012, Meilutyte became Lithuania's first Olympic gold medalist in the pool.
Several years after the death of her mother, Meilutyte moved to England to better her prospects.
Meilutyte says she visualizes her races from start to finish before major swimming meets.
