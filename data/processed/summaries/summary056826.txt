Akbar Ahmed: U.S. can't treat Muslims badly and win "hearts and minds" abroad.
If proposed Islamic center ever attacked, Ahmed says, global violence will ensue.
Islamic center should also include church, synagogue and 9/11 memorial, he writes.
Ahmed: Bishops, rabbis and imams must work together; Obama must call for peace.
