"The Office" returned Thursday to its lowest premiere rating ever.
NBC's comedies "Up All Night" and "Parks and Recreation" also saw low ratings.
The network did have a few great weeks with the start of "Revolution" and "Go On".
The low ratings suggest that NBC is going to have a rough time on Thursdays this fall.
