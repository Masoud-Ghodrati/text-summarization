Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes' funeral took place in his hometown Wednesday.
Hughes died after being hit in the head by a cricket ball last week.
His friend, the Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke, said he felt his spirit.
He said his friend had "left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment".
