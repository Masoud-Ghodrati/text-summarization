Bob Greene: Postal service may kill door-to-door service, switch to 'cluster boxes'.
He says it's an unpopular idea, but postal service must find ways to save money.
He says if a personalized service like mail delivery were proposed today, it wouldn't fly.
Greene: Cluster boxes almost inevitable; postal service is in an unenviable position.
