Patriot anti-missile batteries appeared overnight this week in Japanese capital.
They are deployed in case North Korea carries out its threat to test-fire a missile.
Would take between five and 10 minutes for missile to reach skies over Tokyo.
Japan has deployed these measures before during previous launches.
