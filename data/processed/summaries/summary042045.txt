Married for a year, Brittany Maynard, 29, found she had aggressive brain cancer.
She had six months to live, and she didn't want her family to watch her dying in pain.
Maynard and her family moved to Oregon to take advantage of the Death with Dignity law.
She says nobody has the right to take away the option from someone who is terminally ill.
