John Steinbeck conceived of "The Grapes of Wrath" on a late 1937 summer drive on the famous highway.
"(Get Your Kicks on) Route 66" was partially written while the songwriter and his wife were driving to Los Angeles.
Although the signage is sporadic, Route 66 is properly co-designated "the Will Rogers Highway".
