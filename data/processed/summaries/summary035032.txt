NEW: U.S. Capitol Police are working with the FBI on the investigation.
The FBI says the powder in a package sent to Rep. Raul Grijalva is 'nontoxic'.
A campaign spokesman says there were two swastikas on the package.
It is the third security issue at Grijalva's district offices this year, a spokesman says.
