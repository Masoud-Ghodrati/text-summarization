Malcolm Johnson, who's 6-foot-7, says it's not fair that tall fliers have to pay for extra legroom.
He's on a mission to get Air Canada -- the airline he flies most -- to stop charging the fee.
Johnson filed a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency, but it was rejected.
Johnson is vowing to appeal; the fee is "a penalty for tall people," he says.
