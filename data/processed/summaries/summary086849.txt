Monsieur, a "robotic bartender" machine, can make up to 300 kinds of cocktails.
Customers order on a touchscreen or through their phones.
Each Monsieur comes with 12 themes, such as "bachelorette party," "Irish pub" or "cigar bar".
If you want a Monsieur for personal use, the retail price is $5,000.
