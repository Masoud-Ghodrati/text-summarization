Foxconn is one of the world's largest suppliers of components for the electronics industry.
It assembles products including Apple's iPhone and iPad, Amazon's Kindle and Microsoft's Xbox.
With 1.2 million employees in China alone, production takes place at more than 12 factories.
Critics say workers are treated like machines for low pay in an oppressive environment.
