Carlos Tevez could be set to return to the first-team fold at Manchester City.
Tevez has not played since refusing to warm up as a substitute in September.
City manager Roberto Mancini said Tevez would have to apologize before playing again.
Tevez says on Argentinian television he is not to blame for spat and wants to return.
