NEW: The Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza has reopened, state media say.
The seven soldiers were kidnapped last Thursday in the Sinai Peninsula.
They are now free and heading back to the capital, Cairo, a military spokesman says.
Military intelligence services and Sinai residents cooperated to secure their release, he says.
