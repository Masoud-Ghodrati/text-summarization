Mitt Romney says he ceased managing Bain Capital when he took over Olympics in 1999.
Roberta Karmel says Romney signed SEC documents saying he was Bain CEO after 1999.
She asks why did he continue in that role and why did he get a salary if he had left the job?.
Failure to reveal finances means we don't know how much he made on Bain deals, she says.
