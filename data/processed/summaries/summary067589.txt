Lady Lucy Duff-Gordon's letter to a friend, written just weeks after the Titanic sank, sells for nearly $12,000.
She tells friend of "disgraceful" treatment after rescue, says RR Auction, which sold the letter.
She and her husband were haunted by allegations about their conduct as the ship sank in April 1912.
