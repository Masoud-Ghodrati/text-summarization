TEPCO says it discovered highly contaminated water leaking from a tank.
An estimated 100 metric tons flowed over a barrier and onto the ground, it says.
The company says it has shut off the flow of water into the tank and the leak has stopped.
TEPCO has struggled to manage the vast amounts of tainted water at crippled plant.
