CNN talks with Andrew Gregory, one of the people behind "Auto-Tune the News".
The Gregory Brothers use the technology to alter voices of news-makers.
Gregory says Katie Couric has a good Auto-Tune voice, but Sean Hannity doesn't.
He plans to use the "I am T-Pain" Auto-Tune app in a live performance.
