A Navy SEAL team kills Osama bin Laden during a raid in Pakistan on May 2.
Musharraf says the raid violated Pakistan's sovereignty and was an "act of war".
The former prime minister calls bin Laden's death "absolutely illegal".
Pakistani intelligence commits a "terrible failure" in not knowing where bin Laden was.
