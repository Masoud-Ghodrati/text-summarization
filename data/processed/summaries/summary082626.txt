French Senate passes bill criminalizing public denial of Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey in 1915.
Armenians say Turks committed genocide against more than a million Armenians in waning days of Ottoman Empire.
Turkey says the deaths were due to war, disease and chaos -- not to a specific plan to kill Armenians.
Genocide bill threatens to further destabilize relations between France and Turkey.
