Seattle artist Moxie creates creatures and objects from bright wool felt.
She learned how to felt when she hired an artist while running an afters-school program.
Her "Hunger" series features doll parts being gobbled up by felted aliens.
She says there's a "whimsy, desperate nature and shameful feeling" to some creatures.
