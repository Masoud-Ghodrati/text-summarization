Film director Tony Scott left two notes before his apparent suicide, a coroner official says.
It will be weeks before autopsy results are made public, an official says.
"Unfathomable to think that he is now gone," Denzel Washington says.
Scott is best known for the films "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop II".
