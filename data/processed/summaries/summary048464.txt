Alabama legislators pass 4 restrictive abortions bills; none are state law -- yet.
One would charge doctors for doing abortions if there's a fetal heartbeat detected.
Others deal with consent, mother's sign-off if their unborn child as a fatal defect.
The ACLU says these bills will "invite litigation (that) will cost the state dearly".
