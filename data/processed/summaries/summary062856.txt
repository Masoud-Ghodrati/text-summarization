An Alabama man was sentenced to no prison time for rape conviction.
Danny Cevallos says Alabama law, rules give judges discretion to suspend prison terms.
He says even if the sentence is legal, it may not be a moral one.
Cevallos: People who object should blame legislature and courts, in addition to judge.
