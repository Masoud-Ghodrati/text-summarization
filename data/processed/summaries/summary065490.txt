Gene Seymour: Spike Lee, Quentin Tarantino spatting over "Django Unchained".
Seymour says film, which upends slavery narrative, is classic comic-book Tarantino.
He says debate is over whether white artists have right to tell any part of black American story.
Seymour notes James Baldwin's sound advice: "If you don't like their alternative, write yours".
