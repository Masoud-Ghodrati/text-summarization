Ed Husain: U.S. spent vast blood and treasure on ousting Saddam Hussein, building Iraq ties.
He says when Nuri al-Maliki, Barack Obama met to formally end war, things were tense.
He says Iraq still wants U.S. help aid but avoids U.S. foreign policy aims, has ties to Iran.
Husain: If U.S. can't count on Iraq by now, how will it hold sway in other nations in region?.
