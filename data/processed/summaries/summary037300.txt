LZ Granderson: Romney asking if you're better off than four years ago is wrong question.
He says study shows middle class shrinking for 40 years, with smaller share of wage pie.
LZ: In 1971, rich were 14% of U.S., 29% of income; in 2011: 20% of U.S., 46% income.
LZ: If Romney wants to really do something for country, he'll have plan to address this trend.
