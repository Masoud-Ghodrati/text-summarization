Junior Gotti, son of late "Teflon Don," set to go on trial in federal court.
Gotti is accused of racketeering, participating in two drug murders.
Original indictment was filed in Tampa, Florida; case moved to New York.
Gotti's lawyers say case is part of government effort to convict him at any cost.
