A Muslim woman was shot and killed in 2011 while she was walking with her spouse.
Her husband, who was wounded, first said assailants shouted "slurs about terrorists".
Authorities say the husband later told police he had arranged the shooting.
A grand jury Thursday indicted the husband and a female friend.
