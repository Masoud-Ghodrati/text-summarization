An international team of scientists discovered the first evidence of dinosaurs in Saudi Arabia.
Among the fossilized findings were the teeth of a carnivorous abelisaurid -- a 20-foot tall bipedal dinosaur.
Scientists also uncovered the fossilized vertebrae from the tail of a "Brontosaurus-like" sauropod called a titanosaur.
Experts say the new evidence could reveal more about the how the Earth was formed.
