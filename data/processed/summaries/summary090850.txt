A former European intelligence official offers details on bin Laden's movements after 9/11.
In 2003 and 2004 Western authorities had "a stream of reliable information" on bin Laden.
But the information was never fresh enough for agencies to take action.
The intelligence consensus is that bin Laden is now hiding in the trial areas of Pakistan.
