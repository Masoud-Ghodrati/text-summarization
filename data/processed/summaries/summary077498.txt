CNN's Ivan Watson speaks to ISIS fighters being held by Kurds in northern Syrian prison.
One prisoner claims ISIS paid him $3,600 to plant a bomb that killed his nephew.
Another prisoner, 19, says many fighters he met were foreigners, including one Chinese jihadi.
CNN has no way to confirm if prisoners were telling the truth or being coached.
