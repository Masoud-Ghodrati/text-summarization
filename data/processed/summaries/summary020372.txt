Since Tuesday, engineers have been inside the One57 building on West 57th.
High winds toppled a crane boom some 90 stories above New York City.
Bloomberg said engineers will be "tying the boom to the building so that they can then work around the top of it".
The whole process could take weeks, the mayor said.
