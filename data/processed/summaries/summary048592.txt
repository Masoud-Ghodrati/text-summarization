A man accused of defacing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II is due in court.
Tim Haries has been charged with causing criminal damage over Â£5,000.
The portrait, by the Australian-born artist Ralph Heimans, has been taken down.
It went on display in the abbey last month to mark 60 years since the queen's coronation.
