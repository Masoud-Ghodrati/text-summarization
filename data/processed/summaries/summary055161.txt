Moshe Katsav enters prison after being convicted last year of rape and other sexual offenses.
He continues to insist the evidence against him was flawed as he leaves his home.
He will be kept in a cell block for prisoners who are observant Jews.
Katsav, of the center-right Likud Party, was president of Israel from 2000 to 2007.
