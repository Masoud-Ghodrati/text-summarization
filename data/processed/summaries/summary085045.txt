35 people are confirmed killed by Turkish jets in an airstrike on the border with Iraq.
Those killed are thought to have been smuggling cigarettes, a senior politician says.
The Turkish military says the route the group was using is one often used by terrorists.
The Kurds represent the largest ethnic minority in Turkey.
