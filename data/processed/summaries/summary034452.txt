Talks led by President Giorgio Napolitano begin Wednesday in an effort to forge a government.
Napolitano said he will first try to get agreement on Pierluigi Bersani as prime minister.
Bersani's party holds the lower house, but is vying in the Senate with Silvio Berlusconi's party.
With no agreement, new parliamentary elections would be scheduled.
