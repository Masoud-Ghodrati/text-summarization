Egyptians are voting on a draft constitution that would give the military more power.
The referendum is expected to be followed by presidential and parliamentary elections.
Khaled Fahmy says Egypt appears to be back where it was at the start of the revolution.
But he says if a military dictatorship tries to impose itself, street protests will return.
