NEW: Rebekah Brooks has been cleared of all charges against her at a phone-hacking trial.
Brooks was chief executive of News International until she resigned in July 2011.
She became the youngest-ever editor of a national British newspaper in 2000.
Rupert Murdoch was said to have treated Brooks like a daughter.
