The trial of Gigi Jordan opens with prosecutors saying she gave her son a drug overdose.
Jude Mirra, 8, who was autistic, died from painkillers and anti-inflammatories, prosecutors say.
The defense says the desperate mother aimed to protect her son from a sexually abusive father.
Jordan, charged with second-degree murder, faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.
