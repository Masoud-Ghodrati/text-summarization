Former Nigerian defender Michael Emenalo has been appointed assistant first team coach at Chelsea.
The 45-year-old has been at the London club as head opposition scout since 2007.
Chelsea say promotion is a recognition of Emenalo's efforts at the English Premier League side.
Emenalo replaces Englishman and former Chelsea-player Ray Wilkins in the role.
