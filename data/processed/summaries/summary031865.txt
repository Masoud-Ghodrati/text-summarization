Rep. Luke Messer, 11 other GOP members back Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.
The act, they say, hopes to update job training laws and put millions back to work.
They say there are already more than 50 programs costing $18 billion each year.
The bill will eliminate 15 programs seen as duplicative and retool training needs locally.
