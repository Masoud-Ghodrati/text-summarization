O.J. Simpson was sentenced to 33 years for his role in an incident at a Las Vegas.
A Nevada jury convicted him on 12 counts, including kidnapping and armed robbery.
He asks a parole board to cut his sentence, saying he'd only gone to get his property.
Simpson laments missing graduations, birthdays and a funeral in 5 years in custody.
