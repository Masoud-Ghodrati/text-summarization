Carrie Rickey: The late charactor actor Eli Wallach told a story that the Pope sent him a fan letter.
She says Wallach was great at playing bad guys and was often cast as an "American ethnic".
He acted with big names in film -- Eastwood, Gable, Stiller -- but his love was theater.
Rickey: He worked well into his 90s; beloved for monologues, wit and professionalism.
