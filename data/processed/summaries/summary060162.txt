Copenhagen Zoo under fire for culling healthy family of lions to make way for new animal.
Danish zoo was criticized last month for killing a young giraffe.
Many people now believe that holding animals captive is distasteful, says Liz Tyson.
Tyson: If we want the killing to stop, people must stop going to the zoo.
