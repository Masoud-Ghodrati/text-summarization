Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death, given the death penalty.
There was no evidence tying her to the crime, but a detective said she confessed.
This detective had a "history of misconduct," including lying under oath, a judge says.
"The Constitution requires a fair trial. This never happened in Milke's case," he adds.
