Atlanta police confirm officers stopped Tyler Perry's car last month.
Office of Professional Standards will look into whether Perry was racially profiled, police say.
"It was so hostile," Perry wrote in a Facebook posting Sunday.
The tension was defused when a black officer arrived and explained who Perry is, he says.
