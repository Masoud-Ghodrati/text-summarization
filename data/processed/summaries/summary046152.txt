Six former Bosnian Croat leaders are sent to prison for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The offenses date to between 1992 and 1994, after the break-up of the former Yugoslavia.
The six, who have 30 days to appeal, were part of a campaign of ethnic cleansing, ICTY says.
They used rape, murder and deportation to drive non-Croats from an area they wanted, it says.
