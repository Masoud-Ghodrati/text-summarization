Kasem's daughters claim his wife is isolating the retired radio host from family and friends.
"We're scared that well never see him again," Kasem's brother tells CNN.
Kasem can't speak and "may have early onset Parkinson's dementia," a filing says.
He retired in 2009 after decades of hosting radio's "American Top 40".
