Liya Kebede is an Ethiopian supermodel scouted in Addis Ababa while at school.
Her big break came when she was selected by Tom Ford to walk his A/W Gucci line in 2000.
In 2007 she launched her own fashion label which provides business growth in Ethiopia.
"When I went back to Ethiopia, I wanted to do something. I wanted to give back".
