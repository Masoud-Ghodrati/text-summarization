A Navy sailor had surgery and is stable at a hospital after being shot in the abdomen.
After being stopped, the sailor drove onto the base and hit two cruisers, a spokesman says.
A passenger in the car, who was not injured, is in Navy police custody.
The spokesman says the car was stopped on strong suspicions of drunken driving.
