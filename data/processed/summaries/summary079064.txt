"This is the way she wanted to go," says the daughter of 86-year-old Joy Johnson.
Sunday was her 25th appearance in the 26-mile New York Marathon.
Johnson fell about six miles from the end race, but she kept going to finish.
She appeared Monday on the "Today" show and was resting in her hotel when she died.
