Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader in Arabia was Abu Sufyan al-Azdi, also named Saeed al-Shahri.
Yemen confirms he was killed in a November counter-terrorism operation.
A jihadist had tweeted the death earlier this week, SITE Intelligence Group says.
Al-Azdi was buried by militants at an undisclosed place in Yemen, officials say.
