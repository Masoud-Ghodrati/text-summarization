A Canadian doctor says she was part of a team that examined Harry Burkhart in 2010.
The team included a psychiatrist, the Canadian doctor says.
The diagnosis was "autism, severe anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression".
Burkhart is facing 37 counts of arson in a string of fires in Los Angeles.
