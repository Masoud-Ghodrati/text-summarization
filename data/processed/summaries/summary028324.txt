Steven Slater was "angry" when he blasted a passenger, exited via an evacuation slide.
The flight attendant became a pop culture icon after the incident.
Slater has struck a deal to co-write a book, tentatively titled, "Cabin Pressure".
He's plead guilty to two counts of criminal mischief, and must get counseling, pay a fine.
