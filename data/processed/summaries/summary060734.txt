Andrew Flintoff has announced his retirement from all forms of cricket aged 32.
The all-rounder has been forced to quite because of a long-standing knee injury.
Flintoff played 79 Test matches for England after making his debut in 1998.
The highlight undoubtedly came in 2005 when a Flintoff-inspired England won the Ashes.
