Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Why is it so hard to prevent medical mistakes that kill thousands?.
He says one theory is that doctors order so many procedures to protect themselves.
Each procedure creates a new opportunity for a mistake, he says.
He says "morbidity and mortality" meetings give doctors a chance to learn from mistakes.
