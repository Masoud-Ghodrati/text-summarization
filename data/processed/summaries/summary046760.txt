NEW: Irfan Khan, one of 6 people charged, puts off entering a plea in Los Angeles.
Hafiz and his son Izhar Khan say they both need time to sort out their legal representation.
Federal authorities claim the 6 gave money for a conspiracy to kill, injure and kidnap people.
A Muslim group's official says of the indictment: "Everyone is in shock".
