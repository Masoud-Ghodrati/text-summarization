Like much of Texas, the town of Groesbeck suffered through a summer of intense heat.
Triple-digit temperatures cooked the area for more than 90 days, along with the ongoing drought.
"We lost more water to evaporation than we were using this summer," says the mayor.
"We have about two weeks of water left," says the mayor.
