Philip Chism has a not guilty plea entered on his behalf on the additional rape charge.
It's not clear whether 15-year-old will be treated as a juvenile or adult on this count.
He previously pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery, murder charges.
Authorities say he killed his math teacher at school, then disposed of her body.
