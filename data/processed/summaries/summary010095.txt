Bunce Island was a British slave trading post in the 18th century.
From its shores, tens of thousands of Africans were put on slave ships to Americas.
Abandoned in the 19th century, it's one of the most authentic slave trading facilities still in existence.
One group is working to conserve the island's crumbling ruins.
