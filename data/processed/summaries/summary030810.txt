Landon Donovan has 57 goals and 58 assists in international career, both U.S. records.
Coach Jurgen Klinsmann says he left Donovan off roster because other players are better.
For all the highlights Donovan has amassed, performances of late have been lacking.
If any player on roster is injured before World Cup, Donovan could be back, coach says.
