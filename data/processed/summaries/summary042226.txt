Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, touted Moses, the "In God we trust" motto and the Ten Commandments in a speech Tuesday.
The speech was the four-term House member's final one, coming as she prepares to leave office in January.
Bachmann's exit will end a congressional inquiry into alleged campaign finance violations during her 2012 presidential bid.
