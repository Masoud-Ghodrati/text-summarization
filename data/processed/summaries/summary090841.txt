Alex Hribal, 16, faces 4 counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault.
He is accused of going on a stabbing rampage at his Pennsylvania high school.
Hribal's lawyer describes his client as "a typical young kid" who has "never been in trouble".
"He's scared ... He's 16, looks like he's 12," attorney Patrick Thomassey tells reporters.
