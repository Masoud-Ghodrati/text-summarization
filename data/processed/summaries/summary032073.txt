A wooden cross dedicated to late President Lech Kaczynski has prompted division in Poland.
David Frum says supporters of keeping cross in place favor more traditional values.
He says those in favor of moving cross support dramatic improvements in Polish economy.
Kaczynski's admirers think he was not valued by the elites, Frum says, much like Sarah Palin.
