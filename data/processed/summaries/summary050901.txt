Audio message purportedly of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi calls coalition effort a "failure".
Troops that try to fight ISIS are being sent to "their deaths and destruction".
Message appears days after reports that al-Baghdadi was injured in an airstrike.
CNN cannot confirm those reports, or the audio message allegedly of al-Baghdadi.
