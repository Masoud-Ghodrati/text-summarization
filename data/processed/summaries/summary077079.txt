Turkey's Parliament voted on Thursday to authorize military action against ISIS.
Release of hostages by ISIS leaves Turkey free to reevaluate strategy, says Andreas Krieg.
Krieg: Intervention would create safe haven like one created in Northern Iraq after Gulf War.
Unlikely Turkish forces would advance into jihadists' heartland of Raqqa or Mosul, he adds.
