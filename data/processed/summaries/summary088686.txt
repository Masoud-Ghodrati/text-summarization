President Hassan Rouhani addressed the World Economic Forum on "Iran in the World".
Alex Vatanka says Rouhani had plenty to say about reaching out to the world and Mideast.
But it was notable that he avoided mentioning Israel or Saudi Arabia, he says.
Vatanka says Rouhani has critics at home and knows he needs to choose his battles.
