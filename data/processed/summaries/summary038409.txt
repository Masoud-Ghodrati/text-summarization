Eight wounded U.S. veterans return to Iraq through "Operation Proper Exit" program.
Veterans want troops on the ground to know they're still part of them, organizer says.
Retired lieutenant says progress in Iraq shows he didn't "bleed in vain".
Program is run by Troops First Foundation, backed by USO.
