Hong Kong's border with China includes a 26sq km land zone, the Frontier Closed Area.
The Cold War-era zone has been largely untouched by humans since the 1950s.
The Hong Kong government has recently opened up a portion of the closed area to the public.
Conservationists fear developers could encroach on the zone which is home to migratory birds.
