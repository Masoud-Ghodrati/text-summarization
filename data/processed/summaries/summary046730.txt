A handful of tea party organizations told CNN that they were asked probing questions.
Director of Richmond Tea Party said he first sought tax-exempt status for the group in 2009.
The IRS asked to see private pages that were "accessible only to your members".
The Indiana TEA Party is another conservative group that says it received similar scrutiny.
