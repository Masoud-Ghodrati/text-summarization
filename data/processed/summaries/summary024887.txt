"Everybody's Fine" is targeted at "pretty much everyone," director Kirk Jones told CNN.
Story centers on a father's journey as he seeks to reunite his kids for the holidays.
Each stop reveals how his wife had sheltered him from bad news about his kids.
Jones, who also wrote the screenplay, traveled the U.S. for inspiration.
