Former parliament Speaker Dioncounda Traore is sworn in as interim president of Mali.
Traore says he will not allow Mali to be split by separatist rebels.
He says he wants to talk with the rebels, but failing that, he will wage war against them.
The rebels took advantage of post-coup chaos to seize large areas of northern Mali.
