A record 180,000 people attend a Hong Kong vigil to commemorate 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown.
It's been 23 years since troops opened fire on pro-democracy activists near the Beijing Square.
Highlight of vigil was the attendance of Fang Zheng, who had both legs amputated after he was run over by an army tank.
The vigil attracted children as well as elderly residents who have dutifully come every year.
