Dharun Ravi will go to trial in February over a 15-count indictment involving hate crime charges.
He has turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time.
His roommate, Tyler Clementi, later killed himself, jumping from the George Washington Bridge.
The plea deal would have required 600 hours of community service, among other things.
