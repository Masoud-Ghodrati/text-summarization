Matthew C. Whitaker: Obama's appearance at Arizona school brought out racist protesters.
Report: Sign said, "Impeach the Half-White Muslim!" and some sang "Bye Bye Black Sheep".
Protesters blame Obama for race tension, but his detractors promulgate it, Whitaker says.
Whitaker: Arizona protesters were loud, but such racism is ubiquitous, should worry us all.
