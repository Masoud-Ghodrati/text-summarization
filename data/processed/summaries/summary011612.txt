Bill Clinton reminisced about when he scored 16 points in church league basketball and "almost" dunked the ball.
"It was just one of those magical nights," he said, "My hand got like right at the rim and I almost got the ball dunked in.".
Clinton also spoke about how he got star struck while golfing with Jack Nicklaus and had funny encounters with championship teams at the White House.
