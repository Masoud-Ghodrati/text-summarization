Viktor Troicki returns to the tennis tour after serving a one-year doping suspension.
Troicki didn't fail a test but initially refused to take a blood test in April 2013.
Formerly the No. 12 in the world, Troicki's ranking has fallen to 842nd.
He went back to school during his time away, studying sports management.
