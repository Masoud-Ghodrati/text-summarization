Prosecutors allege a New York-based art dealer bilked buyers by selling them forged art.
Spanish authorities arrested Jose Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, federal prosecutors say.
Investigators allege that he and associates made more than $30 million off fake art.
The painter behind the works was also indicted; Bergantiños met him on a street corner.
