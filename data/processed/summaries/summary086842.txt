The inaugural Pearls Golf Premier League took place in India last month.
Eight franchises were pitted together in a cut down version of the sport.
The format is similar to cricket's Indian Premier League, which was launched in 2008.
Major winners Angel Cabrera and Darren Clarke were paid $55,000 to play in Golf Premier League.
