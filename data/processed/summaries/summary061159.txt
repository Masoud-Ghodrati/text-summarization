Two U.S. flags taken from Brooklyn Bridge expected to be returned to the NYPD Friday.
The NYPD believes a pair of German artists replaced the flags with two white flags.
Two white flags were spotted by construction workers the morning of July 22.
The investigation is ongoing and it's unclear what charges, if any, the artists will face.
