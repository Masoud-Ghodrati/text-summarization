Ferrari team principal says Ross Brawn is "an iconic figure" at the Italian Formula One team.
Marco Mattiacci adds everyone would like to see the former technical director back at Ferrari.
Brawn is on a break from F1 after leaving Mercedes at the end of 2014.
Mattiacci adds any potential return for Brawn would not impinge on his own role.
