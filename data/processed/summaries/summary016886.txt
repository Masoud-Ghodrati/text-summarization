NEW: Troy Davis's sister says she is disappointed and will keep fighting.
The evidence Davis presented is "not credible" or "smoke and mirrors," court finds.
Davis faces execution for killing an off-duty police officer in 1989 but says he is innocent.
He was convicted in 1991 but witnesses have since recanted their testimony.
