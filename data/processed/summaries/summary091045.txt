Derrick Bell is in the news because of a video on a conservative website.
The video shows a young Obama embracing Bell at a 1991 Harvard demonstration.
Bell, who died last year, was a major academic on race and the law.
The website of the late Andrew Breitbart claims Bell promoted anti-white views.
