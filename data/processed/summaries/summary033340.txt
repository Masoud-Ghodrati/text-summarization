Cara Cox was 8 years old when she and her father vanished from Deltona, Florida, in 2009.
Cara was listed as missing; her father, Aaron Cox, was charged with child custody interference.
For years, there were "no viable leads" in the case, but a break came last week, police say.
On Friday, U.S. authorities arrested Cox and recovered Cara in a remote area in Mexico.
