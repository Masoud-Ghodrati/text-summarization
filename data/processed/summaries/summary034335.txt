Victoria Montenegro, 36, learned of her real father just 12 years ago.
She learned this week that a body found in a Uruguayan cemetery was his.
She also learned that her adoptive parents were part of the military regime.
Roque Orlando Montenegro was 20 when he was a victim of the 1976-83 "Dirty War".
