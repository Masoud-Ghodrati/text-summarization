Solar eclipses happen when the sun, moon and Earth are perfectly aligned so that when the moon passes in front of the sun it casts a shadow on the Earth.
On March 20 this year the moon's shadow falls across parts of North Africa, Europe and the Middle East.
The moon is slowly moving away from the Earth so there will come a time when the moon will appear to be too small to cover the sun.
