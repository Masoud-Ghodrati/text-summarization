Marily Jean Hartman, 62, pleaded no contest to stowing away on Southwest flight.
"I don't think it's wise to say how I got through" the security checkpoints, she says.
Hartman was arrested Monday after stowing away on a flight from San Jose to Los Angeles.
She has been arrested at least three times for trying the same thing.
