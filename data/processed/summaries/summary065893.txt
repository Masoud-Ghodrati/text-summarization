Campaign events were largely suspended Monday as Sandy approached the East Coast.
Obama: "I'm worried about the impact on families and I'm worried about the impact on our first responders".
Romney: " A lot of people are enduring some very difficult times, and our hearts and our prayers go to them".
The storm could also affect TV ads, early voting, and polling in some of the battleground states.
