South Africa's 'Blade Runner' fails to set qualifying time for London Olympics.
The 25-year-old falls short in 400 meters at African Championships, finishing second.
He beat the qualifying time earlier this season but needed to do it twice to win a place.
Pistorius still hopes to be selected for South Africa's 4x400m relay team.
