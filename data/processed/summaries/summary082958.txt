Prosecutor: Google should crack down on ads touting unlawful prescription drugs.
"Google is aiding and abetting criminal activity," state prosecutor says.
Google says it's cracking down but results "reflect the web and what's online".
The search giant paid a $500 million civil fine over the issue in 2012.
