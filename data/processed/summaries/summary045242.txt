Pippa Middleton was being chased by paparazzi in Paris, her friend says.
Another person in the car brandished a toy gun at the photographers.
She's the younger sister of Prince William's wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.
The outrage over the incident should be a wake-up call to her, royal watchers say.
