Deaf and mute, nine-year-old Lakhan Kale was being cared for by his grandmother.
She tied him to a pole while she went to work selling trinkets on a Mumbai beachfront.
He now lives in a juvenile center but it's not a home for children with special needs.
Mumbai's suffering a severe shortage of care homes for children with disabilities.
