"I ask myself why they shot me first," Roy Middleton tells CNN in an exclusive interview.
Middleton, 60, is still angry about being shot by Escambia County sheriff's officers.
Sheriff David Morgan maintains that Middleton did not respond to the deputies' commands.
The deputies are on leave; Middleton is preparing a civil lawsuit, his lawyer says.
