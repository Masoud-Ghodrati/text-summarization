Two-time Indy 500 champ Dan Wheldon died at Las Vegas track in October.
IndyCar says it needs more time for an investigation and to test its new car.
Las Vegas track is comparatively wide, allowing more side-by-side racing.
"This is not a suitable track," driver Dario Franchitti told ABC News after the crash.
