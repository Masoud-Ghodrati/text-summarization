NEW: Connecticut's governor signs tough gun-control bill.
NEW: "Today does not mark the end of our efforts," Gov. Dannel Malloy says.
The new law adds more than 100 guns to the state's assault weapon ban.
Critics say it will do little to stop determined criminals, but supporters call the bill historic.
