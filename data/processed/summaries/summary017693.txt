The word Chanukah or Hanukkah means re-dedication and is also known as the Jewish Festival of Lights.
It is celebrated for eight days and each day a candle on the Hanukiah -- an eight-stemmed candelabrum -- is lit.
Popular Chanukah food includes latkes (fried potato pancakes) and sufganiyots (doughnuts).
