28 hospitals release reports into abuse by Jimmy Savile of patients and staff.
Health secretary: "Savile was a callous, opportunistic, wicked predator".
Reports detail rapes, abuses and claims of sexual behavior with dead bodies.
TV star used his popularity "to perpetrate and cover up his own evil acts," health secretary says.
