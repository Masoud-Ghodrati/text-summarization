A taxi jumps a curb at a busy intersection and hits a British tourist and a cyclist, police say.
Dr. Oz and his student staffers run to the scene about a block away from their office.
The tourist's foot is amputated, and a good Samaritan uses his belt as a tourniquet.
Oz, who tightened the makeshift tourniquet, praises the plumber who jumped into action.
