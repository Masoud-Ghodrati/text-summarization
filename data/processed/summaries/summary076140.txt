NEW: A charter captain describes coming upon three men clinging to a capsized boat.
NEW: He says one was upset because "he lost his mother," who had slipped away.
The Coast Guard later rescued four more who'd been on the boat, including a young girl.
A witness says the girl "couldn't stop crying" when rescuers brought her ashore.
