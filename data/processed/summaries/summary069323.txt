Fighting broke out Thursday in Malakal, near the border dividing northern, southern Sudan.
Soldiers loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang refused to turn in their weapons.
Tang had fought alongside government and loyalist forces in southern Sudan.
Southern Sudanese voted last month on a referendum for independence.
