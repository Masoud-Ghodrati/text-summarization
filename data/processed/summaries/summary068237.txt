NEW: MIchael Jackson won a new fan during trial -- the jury foreman.
Jury foreman: "I don't see it as a vindication of Dr. Murray".
"For once, the world was allowed to hear some of the facts," Dr. Conrad Murray says.
Jackson lawyer: "We have said from the beginning that this case was a search for the truth".
