Thomas Bjorn takes one-shot lead on penultimate day of Qatar Masters after a round of 66.
The 39-year-old shot a bogey-free round to usurp Austria's Markus Brier at the top.
Brier could not repeat Friday's 66 and finished on 69 after bogey at final hole.
Defending champion Robert Karlsson is still in with a chance, three shots off lead.
