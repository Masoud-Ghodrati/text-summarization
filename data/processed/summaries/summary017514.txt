U.S. Marshals Southeast task force tracks 10-15 suspected killers a day.
Some are high-profile cases, but most are searches that go under media radar.
Commander: "Our mandate is to track ... murderers, armed robbers, rapists".
Office captured 3,000 suspects last year; only once were shots fired, chief says.
