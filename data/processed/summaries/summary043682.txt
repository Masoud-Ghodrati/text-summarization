Peter O'Toole was an outstanding actor and a movie star, writes Gene Seymour.
He showed his versatility in everything from "Lawrence of Arabia" to "My Favorite Year".
Seymour: O'Toole deserved, but didn't get, an Oscar for performance as T. E. Lawrence.
He says O'Toole enchants and frightens the viewer of "The Ruling Class".
