Pedro Noguera says public safety can't rely on gun laws and police presence alone.
Noguera: We rely on a social contract that says to live safely we give up some freedoms.
As community and religion bonds weaken, we find ourselves at greater risk, he writes.
He says we must restrict access to guns but also work to strengthen community bonds.
