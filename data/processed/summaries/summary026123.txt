Deepak Chopra: Giving part of inner growth, but corruption in charities makes us pause.
Don't stop giving, just be smart about it. Seek accountability; ask where your money goes.
Chopra: Help people reach aspirations. Invest in future.
Give of your spirit. Helping someone in person can do more than money to change a life.
