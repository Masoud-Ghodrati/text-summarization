More than 2,300 mourners fill St. Paul's Cathedral for Margaret Thatcher's funeral.
Among them are foreign dignitaries, UK politicians and Queen Elizabeth II.
This is "the place for simple truths which transcend political debate," says Bishop of London.
Thatcher's granddaughter, Amanda, gives one reading, PM David Cameron another.
