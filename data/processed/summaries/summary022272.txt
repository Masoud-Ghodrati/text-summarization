CNN journalists pay tribute to cameraman Mick Deane, a former co-worker.
Deane was killed while covering the violence in Cairo for Sky News.
His producer says he was shot by a sniper as he lifted his camera to film at sit-in camp.
Deane, 61, had worked for Sky for 15 years, based in Washington and Jerusalem.
