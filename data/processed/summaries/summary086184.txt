The crimes occurred Friday in a suburb west of Rio de Janeiro, police say.
Police say a gunman robbed passengers and forced them to the front of the bus.
He then raped a woman and beat her with a gun, a police report says.
In March, an American tourist was raped, beaten on a minibus in Rio's Copacabana area.
