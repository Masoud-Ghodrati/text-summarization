Maria Sharapova names Sven Groeneveld as her new tennis coach.
Sharapova has been without a coach since a brief spell with Jimmy Connors.
Groeneveld has worked with the likes of Ana Ivanovic, Caroline Wozniacki and Andy Murray.
Sharapova hasn't played since August because of a recurring shoulder injury.
