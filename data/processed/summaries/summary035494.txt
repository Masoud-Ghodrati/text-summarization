A park in Lower Manhattan is crowded with "Occupy Wall Street" protesters.
This effort began in July, and people have camped out there for 3 weeks now.
Similar efforts have sprung up in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle.
The movement is leaderless and its members have various "political persuasions".
