A Florida jail inmate says watching the jail's few movies over and over is "torture".
Jail officials say they don't have cable TV for cost reasons, but they do have movies and DVDs.
The inmate wants to take it to court.
He's been at the jail nearly four years after filing 15 court motions delaying his trial.
