Police are investigating the possible murder of three boys and claims of sexual abuse.
The abuse is believed to have taken place at locations in central London and elsewhere.
Detective appeals for other boys, now men, who were abused to come forward.
The abuse allegations date back to the 1970s and 1980s, police say.
