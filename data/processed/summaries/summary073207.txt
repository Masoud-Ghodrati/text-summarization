Kim Clijsters would prefer her daughter not to play professional tennis.
The four-time grand slam winner ended her career after this year's U.S. Open.
The Belgian reached the top of the world rankings and earned over $24 million.
Clijsters' mother was a gymnast and her father was a professional footballer.
