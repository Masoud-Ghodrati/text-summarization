Jeff Pearlman: Michael Phelps should stick to his plan, forget Rio in 2016 and retire.
He says sports history is lousy with icons who didn't quit when they should have and fell short.
He says main reason to ignore advice to keep competing is that Phelps should begin to live life.
Pearlman: Olympics is great moment in time, but it can't last.
