Jean H. Lee may have been the first person to send a mobile tweet from North Korea.
The country last month launched a new 3G wireless network, available only to foreigners.
Lee, of the AP, is the only U.S. reporter granted regular access to the secretive nation.
She spoke Saturday at the South by Southwest Interactive festival in Texas.
