The mother and grandmother of Jerry Brown Jr. appear on CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight".
Brown, an outside linebacker on the Dallas practice squad, was killed in a weekend car crash.
His teammate, Josh Brent, was arrested on suspicion of intoxication manslaughter.
"My heart, every part of me aches," says Brown's grandmother.
