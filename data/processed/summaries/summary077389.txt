JR, a French street artist, brought his "Inside Out" project to Times Square in New York.
A documentary about JR will debut on HBO on May 20 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.
"Inside Out" is a social experiment in how people see themselves and reflect society.
JR tends to focus on people and faces that most would easily ignore or forget.
