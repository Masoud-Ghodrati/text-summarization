Joseph and Summer McStay, and their two boys, vanished from home in February 2010.
Their bodies were found in the Mojave Desert nearly four years later, buried in shallow graves.
From the start, the case has baffled investigators, but they aren't giving up.
"I could have probably hired some Boy Scouts and done a better job," says Joseph's father.
