Airline chairman: Heather Cho will be resigning from all posts with the company.
Korean Air said previously she had resigned from some roles but was keeping her VP title.
The chairman, who is also her father, blames himself, saying he raised her badly.
Cho ordered a plane back to the gate after a flight attendant served nuts in a bag.
