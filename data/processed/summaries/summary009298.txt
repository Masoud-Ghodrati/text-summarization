The English Premier League have rejected a proposal to bring Celtic and Rangers into English football's top flight.
The Glasgow-based sides had hoped to be part of plans submitted by Bolton chairman Phil Gartside.
Rangers have also been fined by UEFA for the behavior of their fans during their match against Unirea Urziceni.
