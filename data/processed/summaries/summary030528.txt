Police say a woman in Halifax, Canada, thought her husband was aboard a plane.
They say she didn't want him to leave, so she climbed a barbed wire fence to stop it.
She never got near any aircraft -- and turns out her husband wasn't on any plane.
Criminal charges called unlikely; airport reviewing security.
