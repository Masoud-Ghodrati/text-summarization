Alan Gross, jailed in Cuba, says his May 2 birthday will be his last in Havana, lawyer says.
Gross was convicted for bringing satellite communications to the island for USAID.
He launched a hunger strike after details of agency's "Cuban Twitter" plan surfaced.
Gross "will die in Cuba" without more effort from U.S. officials, lawyer says.
