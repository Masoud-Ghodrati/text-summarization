A group of 17 brothers and sisters hits the Pick-6 lottery for a jackpot of $20.1 million.
Playing the lotto as a group is a family tradition started by their mother.
Four members of the family lost their homes in Superstorm Sandy.
"It couldn't have come at a better time," a family spokeswoman says.
