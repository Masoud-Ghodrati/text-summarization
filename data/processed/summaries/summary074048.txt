Antonio Rodriguez is convicted of murder in the deaths of three women.
The women were killed and sexually assaulted in 2010 in Philadelphia.
Their assailant was nicknamed the "Kensington Strangler" for the neighborhood of the crimes.
Rodriguez is sentenced three life terms; prosecutor says the city "is a little bit safer".
