Kevin Quick's phone has been turned off since Friday night.
Police have gotten at least 50 tips but still haven't found the missing captain.
His family became worried when Quick didn't show up for a party he'd planned.
Authorities ask for help in locating 2 men who photos link to Quick's Toyota SUV.
