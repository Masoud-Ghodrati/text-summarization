U.N. experts say a wreck found off Haiti is not that of the long-lost Santa Maria.
An American explorer said in May he believed he'd found Christopher Columbus' flagship.
But UNESCO says that bronze or copper fasteners at the site indicate it was a later wreck.
The Santa Maria foundered in 1492 as Columbus made his first voyage to the Americas.
