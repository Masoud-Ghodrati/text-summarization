Rock star Ted Nugent invites CNN to his ranch to discuss Second Amendment rights.
Leave gun owners alone, he says; go after the deranged and the repeat offenders.
Nugent: "There is no gun violence," he says. "There is only criminal violence".
Guns, he says, are a "wonderful tool" for self-defense, competition and sport.
