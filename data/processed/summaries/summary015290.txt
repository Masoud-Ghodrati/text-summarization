Phare is an edgy, all-singing-and-dancing circus in the Cirque du Soleil tradition.
It was established in 1994 in Battambang to help disadvantaged kids.
The history of Cambodia's circus tradition dates to the 6th century.
Some 1,400 students are enrolled at the school in Battambang, a small rural city near the Thai border.
