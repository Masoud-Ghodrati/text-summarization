Four "strikes northeast of Falluja" struck a mortar team and ISIS units, Pentagon says.
Official says copters were used because they're precise and Iraqi forces were close.
Copters fly lower and are slower than jet fighters, so they're more vulnerable to ground attacks.
Given ISIS advances, the official said, there will be more attacks against ISIS targets.
