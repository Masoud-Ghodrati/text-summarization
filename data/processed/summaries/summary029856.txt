Leanne Bearden was reported missing January 17 after not returning from a walk.
A big search in Texas followed for the 33-year-old world traveler.
The family says "there is evidence that Leanne may have voluntarily left the area".
They call her "extremely vulnerable" and continue asking for the public's help.
