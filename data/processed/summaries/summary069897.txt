People who know Mohammed Hamzah Khan describe him as nice and polite.
"He's the last person that we'd think that would happen to," says a member of his mosque.
Khan lives in Bolingbrook, a working-class suburb of Chicago, with his family.
He graduated from an Islamic school on his street and taught at a local mosque, neighbors say.
