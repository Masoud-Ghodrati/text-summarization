Eric Cantor: There's a difference between the actions of Hamas and Israel.
He says Hamas fires rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas; Israel defends itself.
Cantor: Support from Turkey and Qatar encourages Hamas' aggression.
He says for cease-fire to last, Hamas must stop terrorism, accept Israel's right to exist.
