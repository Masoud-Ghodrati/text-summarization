Of top finishers at Belmont, only California Chrome had run first two legs of Triple Crown.
Co-owner Steve Coburn spent two days complaining about the system.
He says he was caught up in the emotions of wanting "America's horse" to win.
California Chrome was injured but will race again, owner says.
