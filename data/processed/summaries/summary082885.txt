Russian President Vladimir Putin says homosexuals have nothing to fear in Russia.
"You can feel safe and free here, but please leave our children in peace," he says.
His remarks come as he meets volunteers for the upcoming Winter Olympics.
Putin told ambassadors Thursday the games would be held "without any discrimination".
