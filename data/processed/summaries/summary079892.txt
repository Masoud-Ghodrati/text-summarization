Rui Chenggang is known for his "big get" interviews and his nationalistic sentiment.
Prosecutors took Rui into custody just before the start of "Economic News".
Rui's patron Guo Zhenxi was detained in June for allegedly accepting bribes.
Rui's detention is the latest twist in a widening anti-corruption campaign in China.
