William Rockefeller Jr. is the man at the center of New York's train derailment.
According to a union rep, he's been a locomotive engineer for almost 11 years.
"He's a man of a lot of character. He's honest. He's sincere," the rep says.
Rockefeller's lawyer says his client is married, with a stepson and granddaughter.
