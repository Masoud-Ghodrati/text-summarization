Ed Morrissey: New York mayor's proposal to ban soda size servings is wrong.
He says it makes no sense: What's to stop people from drinking too much soda?.
He calls Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal a nanny-state rule.
Morrissey: New rule would dictate mayor's choices and eliminate everyone else's.
