Online buzz is strong for upcoming "Batman: Arkham Asylum" video game.
Lead writer Paul Dini and others discuss the game at Comic-Con this weekend.
The game reunites a brooding Batman and his most notorious nemesis, the Joker.
There's no movie or comic tie-in to follow, so Dini could create an original story.
