CNN affiliate KUSA says it has a copy of Evan Ebel's plea agreement from 2008 assault.
It says Ebel was sentenced to four years 'consecutively,' which should have been added to his prison term.
Official court documents did not specify 'concurrent' or 'consecutive' so prison officials made the sentence concurrent.
Ebel was released in January, and is suspected of killing the prison system chief in March.
