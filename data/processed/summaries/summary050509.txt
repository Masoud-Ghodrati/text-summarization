Journalist Lubna al-Hussein faced 40 lashes for wearing pants deemed too tight.
On Monday, she was spared lashing and ordered to pay fine or face imprisonment.
Al-Hussein was convicted in day-long trial in which she was unable to call witnesses.
She was arrested in July with 18 others in a police clothing-check at restaurant.
