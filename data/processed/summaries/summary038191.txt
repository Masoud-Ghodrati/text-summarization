China's third city Guangzhou announces first steps in unbolting 'Re-education Through Labor' system.
System was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet 'gulags'.
It provides for detention without trial for petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers.
Human Rights Watch says the changes to the system, however, are only cosmetic.
