"We will succeed as one city," Bill de Blasio says in his inaugural speech.
Former President Bill Clinton administers the oath of office outside City Hall.
De Blasio was ceremoniously sworn in shortly after midnight outside his Brooklyn home.
He replaces billionaire Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led New York for 12 years.
