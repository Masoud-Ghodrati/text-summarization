Orbital Sciences built the unmanned Antares rocket that exploded in a fireball Tuesday.
NASA has hired it and SpaceX to shuttle cargo to the International Space Station.
This is the first such accident since NASA turned to the private sector for the cargo missions.
But NASA has always relied on private industry, and the blast isn't likely to change that.
