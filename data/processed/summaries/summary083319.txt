NEW: At least 5 people have been hurt in London sidewalk explosions since January 2012.
Health and safety body has ordered a major inspection program to fix the problem.
"I turned back and saw a big fire gushing up," says a London worker who had a near miss.
UK Power Networks says there have been "relatively few cases" of such faults.
