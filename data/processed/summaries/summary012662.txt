Ex-Formula One driver Alex Zanardi claims gold medal in hand cycling at the London 2012 Paralympics.
He lost both his legs in a horrific crash in 2001 but continued in motorsport.
Italian first tried hand cycling in 2007 and made it his new career two years later.
The 45-year-old says he has made the most of the chances fate has given him.
