Jay Parini: Gallup poll finds Vermont least religious state. Mississippi is most religious.
He says in South, religion all over radio, road signs, towns; in Vermont fewer go to church.
But Vermont ranks high on environment, health care. Mississippi ranks at bottom.
Parini: Vermonters spiritual seekers, God-hungry: neighbor-helpers more than churchgoers.
