CNN talks to Jamaican double 200-meter gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown.
She could make history if she wins a third gold at London 2012.
Campbell-Brown hails from Trelawny, the same parish that produced Usain Bolt.
Last year she ran the 100 meters in 10.76 second, the second fastest time in history.
