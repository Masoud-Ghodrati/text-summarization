The government accuses Pu Zhiqiang of "picking quarrels and creating a disturbance".
He was detained in May after attending a seminar marking Tiananmen Square anniversary.
Pu took part in demonstrations in 1989 in the square that ended in a bloody military crackdown.
His work has put him at odds with the ruling Communist Party.
