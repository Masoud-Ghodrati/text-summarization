Lawyer Kathy Jorrie negotiated and wrote the contract between AEG Live and Dr. Murray.
Murray told Jorrie he was closing four profitable clinics to take the job as Jackson's doctor.
An investigator testified Murray was $1 million in debt and his clinic faced eviction.
Jackson lawsuit contends AEG Live failed to check Murray's background.
