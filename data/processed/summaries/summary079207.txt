China's work environment gives women more opportunities for success, says top businesswoman.
Jennifer Li is CFO of Baidu, the world's largest Chinese-language search engine.
Baidu, which has 78% share of China's internet market, employs slightly more women than men, says Li.
Li: "Gender is not a factor. To be a successful career person, it's about a passion for excellence".
