Investigators have found chickens infected with H7N3 on 18 farms in central Mexico.
Authorities say the outbreak has been controlled and does not pose a threat to humans.
More than 1.2 million infected chickens were slaughtered, a state agriculture official says.
Nearly 2 million chickens have been vaccinated against the virus since the outbreak began.
