Five members of a Chinese cult have been sentenced for a murder in a McDonald's.
Two were sentenced to death for the killing of a woman who refused to give them her number.
The group, Church of Almighty God, has been banned in China since 1995.
Its members believe Jesus has been reincarnated as a Chinese woman.
