Dutch officials have commissioned the transport of the wreckage back to the Netherlands.
They say the recovery operation is expected to take several days.
The passenger jet carrying 298 people was shot down in July over eastern Ukraine.
Investigators were prevented from accessing the site by the unstable situation.
