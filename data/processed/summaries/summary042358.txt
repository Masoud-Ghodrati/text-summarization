Kevin Clarke: Pope Benedict XVI's decision to resign caught papal watchers off-guard.
Clarke: But canon law allows papal resignation; it's tradition that popes reign till death.
Benedict said a pope is obligated to resign if he can't handle duties.
Clarke: Whoever is chosen will deal with huge challenges facing Catholic Church.
