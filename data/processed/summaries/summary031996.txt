Lawyer Okorie Okorocha claims client text messages support his case against Gloria Allred.
The sex battery suit was dismissed as the plaintiffs left Okorocha and hired Allred.
Allred insists John Doe plaintiffs called her.
Allred says she's considering refiling the suit against Travolta in another court.
