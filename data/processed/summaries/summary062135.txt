David Bianculli: Why are we so riveted by "Breaking Bad" finale, "Homeland" season premiere?.
He says "Sopranos" paved way for anti-heroes; among those that followed, these two shine.
He says "Bad" finale especially anticipated because it's providing actual ending.
Bianculli: "Homeland" still draws, but not as hot as "Bad," where interest built to fever pitch.
