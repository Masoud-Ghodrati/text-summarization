Writer Orson Scott Card will pen a new "Adventures of Superman" digital comics series.
Card also has written outspoken criticism of homosexuality and same-sex marriage.
A marriage-equality group launches a petition aimed at the "Superman" publisher.
"You are giving him a new platform and supporting his hate," says the petition.
