New Zealand's Zac Guildford has apologized for an incident in the Cook Islands last week.
The All Blacks wing is said to have entered a bar drunk, naked and wet.
Guildford allegedly assaulted two patrons at the bar in Rarotonga.
Guildford: "My behavior was unacceptable and I am hugely embarrassed".
