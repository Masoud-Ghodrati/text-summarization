With a nod to Zuckerberg, ex-Facebook president Sean Parker joins Twitter.
"Sorry Zuck," starts Parker's lone tweet on the account he started Monday.
Parker co-founded Napster and is known through his portrayal in "The Social Network".
New account comes as Parker is reportedly about to launch a video service.
