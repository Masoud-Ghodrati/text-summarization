Enric Sala, National Geographic's explorer-in-residence, is aiming to clean up the seas.
His latest mission took him to relatively unknown waters off New Caledonia.
As a child he was inspired by the work of prestigious explorer Jacques Cousteau.
Previously he thought all hope was lost to restoring the seas, he has since changed his mind.
