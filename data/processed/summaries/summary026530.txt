Amnesty International alleges the systemic use of torture by the police in Nigeria.
Methods used include nail or tooth extractions, choking, electric shocks and rape, it says.
A spokesman for the Nigeria Police Force refutes the claim, cites "blatant falsehoods".
"Torture or ill-treatment is not, repeat, not an official policy of the Nigeria Police," he says.
