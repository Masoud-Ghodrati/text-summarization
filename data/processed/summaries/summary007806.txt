Harry Patch, dead at 111, was last British survivor of World War One trench warfare.
Patch was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at Battle of Passchendaele.
Patch "tried to suppress memories and to live as normal a life as possible".
Former soldier gradually opened up about his experiences in final years of life.
