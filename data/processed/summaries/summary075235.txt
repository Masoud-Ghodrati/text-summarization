Judge reversed rape verdict, saying woman didn't act like a victim, man didn't act like rapist.
David Perry: The victim "Jane" has Down syndrome, but that is not reason for outrage.
Perry: See "Jane" not as person with Down syndrome, but as a woman who wasn't believed.
Perry says judges blame victims, dismiss cases cause victims "didn't fight back".
