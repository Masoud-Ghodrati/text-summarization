NEW: James Bain released from prison after more than three decades behind bars.
Bain was convicted in 1974 of abducting and raping a 9-year-old Florida boy.
His case was reopened after his fifth request to use DNA evidence.
The victim, now 44, said "the right person should be punished" for the crime.
