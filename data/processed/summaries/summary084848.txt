Popes have used a string of Mercedes-Benz vehicles since 1930.
When popes visit different countries, hosts submit details of proposed transport.
If it's secure enough, it gets go-ahead. Otherwise, Vatican supplies own vehicle.
Since 2007 pope uses bullet-proof, bomb-proof Mercedes capable of 160mph.
