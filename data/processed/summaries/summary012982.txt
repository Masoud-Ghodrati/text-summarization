WeChat messaging app users typing in the phrase "civil rights" were inundated with U.S. flags.
WeChat said the U.S. flag special feature was in honor of the Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
However, no special icons appeared when patriotic Chinese terms were entered.
And it was only meant to be seen only by users in the U.S., not in other regions.
