Diana Nyad wore a custom-made silicone face mask to protect her against jellyfish stings.
Box jellyfish, common to waters off Florida, contain toxic venom that can stun or kill prey.
The mask was developed by Stefan Knauss, a California prosthetics expert.
People joked about the mask's scary look on Twitter.
