Amnesty International says the torture of detainees and unfair trials plague Iraq.
The group says detainees are tortured into confessing and sometimes sentenced to death.
Reported methods of torture include shocks to the genitals, beatings and partial suffocation.
Sectarian strife between Sunni and Shiite Muslims also plagues the country.
