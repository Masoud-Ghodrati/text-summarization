The Pakistan Taliban say Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif turned Pakistan into a U.S. colony.
They say they blame him for the death of their former leader, who died in a U.S. drone strike.
The terrorist group vows revenge attacks, starting with Sharif's home province of Punjab.
The group has chosen a new leader, who might be linked to the attack on Malala Yousafzai.
