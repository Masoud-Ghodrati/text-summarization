Two inmates broke out of Union County Jail Saturday night, officials say.
They removed blocks from walls, hiding their work behind pinups of women in bikinis.
The duo made it over 25-foot fence to escape jail's top-security area.
One was awaiting sentence for manslaughter; the other faced robbery charges.
