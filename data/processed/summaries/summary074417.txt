NEW: The withdrawal of U.S. troops stirs conflicting emotions on the streets of Baghdad.
About 500 U.S. soldiers cross into Kuwait, ending almost nine years of war in Iraq.
They are the last U.S. troops in the largest drawdown since the Vietnam War.
They make the journey south from Camp Adder, the U.S. base closest to Kuwaiti border.
