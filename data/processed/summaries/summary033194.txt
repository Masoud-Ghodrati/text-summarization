Nearly 800 Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep dealerships must stop selling new cars by June 9.
The company isn't buying the inventory back because it is bankrupt.
Chrysler has only offered to help find surviving dealerships willing to buy the cars.
As a result, the owners of the closing dealerships are suffering huge losses.
