Authorities in the Czech Republic announce they've arrested a 29-year-old man.
Weapons, ammunition and police uniforms were seized from his Ostrava home.
The suspect "sympathizes probably" with Norway mass killer Anders Breivik, police say.
Breivik is a self-declared ultranationalist opposed to multiculturalism.
