NBC's "Today" show airs audio excerpts of an interview with Jerry Sandusky in prison.
The former Penn State assistant football coach raps prosecution witness Mike McQueary.
Sandusky says he's not sure if head coach Joe Paterno suspected he was a pedophile.
The filmmaker says he's trying to give Paterno "his day in court" after "he was railroaded".
