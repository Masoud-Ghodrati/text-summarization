NEW: An Air Force official says no gunman was found and the site is "secure".
The lock down was initiated hours earlier after "unconfirmed sightings" of an armed man.
FBI agents, along with Tucson police, were dispatched to the Arizona air base to help.
No shots were fired and no one was hurt, a U.S. military official says.
