Auburn Avenue in Atlanta is a historic African-American business and cultural hub.
The area bustled with activity during segregation but has fallen on hard times since.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has designated the area 'endangered' twice.
Stakeholders want business and residential growth to preserve Auburn's history.
