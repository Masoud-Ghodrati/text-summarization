Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is facing extradition to the United States.
He used the presidency as his personal ATM, U.S. federal prosecutor says.
Portillo says he was targeted because he "did not support...the invasion in Iraq".
A State Department spokeswoman declines to comment on his extradition.
