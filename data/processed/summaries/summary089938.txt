NEW: Aung San Suu Kyi addresses both British houses of Parliament, a rare honor.
David Cameron says Britain will remain a "resolute friend" of her country, Myanmar.
Suu Kyi is on her first visit to Britain in 24 years.
Political reforms mean she can finally travel, after spending years under house arrest.
