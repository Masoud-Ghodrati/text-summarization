Scientists have analyzed King Richard III's skeletal remains to see how he was killed.
They found evidence of 11 injuries at the time of death, three of them potentially fatal.
Two head injuries are the most likely to have killed the king, scientists say.
Richard III's remains were found in 2012 under a parking lot in the city of Leicester.
