Taylor Anderson's passion for Japan led her to Miyagi Prefecture to teach English.
"When she found out she was going to Japan, it was such a blessing for her," friend says.
She was last seen riding bike from school after quake; parents say her body has been found.
"There's a great lesson in the fact that Taylor followed her passion," school president says.
