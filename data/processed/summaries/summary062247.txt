Sheriff says it's "highly, highly probable" that deceased convict Paul Rowles is prime suspect.
Tiffany Sessions, 20, disappeared in 1989 after going for a jog in Gainesville, Florida.
Rowles had a calendar entry saying "No. 2" beside Sessions' date of disappearance.
Police ask anyone with knowledge of Rowles' life to call 352-384-3323.
