NEW: Teams of horses pull guns into position in Hyde Park for a 41-gun salute.
A 62-gun salute is fired at the Tower of London for the Queen's 86th birthday.
The Queen has an official birthday in June when she takes part in public events.
She celebrates her Diamond Jubilee -- marking 60 years on the throne -- this year.
