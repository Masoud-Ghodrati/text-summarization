The U.S. State Department has begun engaging with Muslim extremists on social media.
It hopes to dissuade potential Islamic militants by presenting an alternative viewpoint.
Some have derided the initiative as 'trolling,' while others say it is rattling jihadist leaders.
Social media has become a vital recruiting ground for Islamic extremists.
