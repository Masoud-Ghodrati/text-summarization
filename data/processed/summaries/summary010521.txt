17 women were arrested at a March 9 protest in Cairo, after Mubarak's ouster.
A senior Egyptian general says some of them were subject to "virginity checks".
He says it was done so that they wouldn't claim later they had been raped.
One woman allegedly targeted had said, "They wanted to teach us a lesson".
