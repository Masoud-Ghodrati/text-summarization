Richie Havens, who came to wide fame as the opening act at Woodstock, died Monday.
He wrote a recollection of the festival for CNN.com on its 40th anniversary in 2009.
Havens said he took the stage to perform his iconic set when other acts were delayed.
Havens: In a pre-digital age, Woodstock was a peaceful protest and global celebration.
