Cape and scarf made of spider silk on display at London's V&A Museum.
Dozens of specially-trained handlers spent seven years collecting more than 1.2 million golden orb spiders.
Bright yellow, extremely strong silk was harvested from the spiders, which were later released back into the wild.
Cape is embroidered with spiders, brocade scarf is woven in traditional Malagasy style.
