Bob Greene: This week, the few remaining Doolittle Raiders will reunite.
In 1942 the 80 men bombed Tokyo in death-defying mission, retaliation for Pearl Harbor.
A case of 80 goblets is brought to their annual reunions. When a Raider dies a cup is upended.
This year, there are four left. They'll toast the Raiders with aged cognac, and end reunions.
