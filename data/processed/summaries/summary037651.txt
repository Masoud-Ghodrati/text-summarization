Ben Ali is facing a tribunal in absentia for his alleged role in the killing of protesters.
In a statement released by his lawyer last June he said he was a victim of "injustice".
Ben Ali trained as a soldier and became head of the defense ministry's intelligence section.
Middle-East and Africa analyst Dr Claire Spencer believes that Ben Ali became a victim of his own political blindness.
