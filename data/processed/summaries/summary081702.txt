Judge allows Zimmerman defense to introduce Trayvon Martin's toxicology report.
The teenager had THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in his system, the report says.
Prosecutors objected to the admission of the report, saying it is bad-character evidence.
Defense attorneys say alleged marijuana use may have affected Martin's decisions.
