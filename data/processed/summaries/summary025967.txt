On March 11, 2004, bombs on four trains in Madrid left hundreds dead and wounded.
The attacks took place near the home of CNN's Al Goodman, who recalls the incident.
Father of Vera de Benito, aged nine at the time, had boarded one of the ill-fated trains.
This week the main victim groups are expected to unite at a mass for the first time in years.
