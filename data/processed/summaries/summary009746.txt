Rubies in the Rubble is a luxury preserve brand that turns food waste into delicious chutneys and jams.
After researching food waste in 2010, founder Jenny Dawson sought to tackle the growing problem of excessive food waste.
The business now sells a selection of preserves through high-end outlets such as Selfridges and Harvey Nichols.
