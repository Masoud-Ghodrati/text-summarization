Former Bosnian Serb army commander Ratko Mladic on trial for crimes against humanity.
Mladic is accused of being involved in slaughter of 8,000 Muslims at Srebrenica.
Mladic is charged with leading 1992 siege against city of Sarajevo, an assault that lasted two years.
Trial could usher in political backlash from Bosnian electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero.
