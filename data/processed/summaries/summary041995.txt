Hong Kong's network of sky slums are barnacled onto roofs of tenements built in 1950s, '60s.
Mostly found in old urban areas in Kowloon -- Sham Shui Po, Kwun Tung and Tai Kok Tsui.
Contrasts with luxury apartments that can often fetch up to US$12.85 million.
Slums stem from housing crises of 1950s, 60s when waves of Chinese refugees arrived.
