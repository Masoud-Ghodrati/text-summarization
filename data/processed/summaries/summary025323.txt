A security guard didn't let Tara Sullivan into the Masters locker room for an interview.
Sullivan says it's "inexcusable" that the guard didn't know the club's policies.
A spokesman for the elite club apologized, saying, "It should not have happened".
Only men can be Augusta National members, but female reporters are allowed access.
