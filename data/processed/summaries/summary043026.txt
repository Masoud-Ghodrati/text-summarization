Federal agents raid the office of a Florida doctor who has given to Democratic causes.
A past recipient is Sen. Menendez, who flew on the doctor's plane to the Caribbean.
Dr. Salomon Melgen has a stake in a port security company involved in work in the Dominican Republic.
Menendez has touted better port security in Dominican Republic, but didn't mention that firm.
