NEW: Mundu, a 2-year-old koala, is back and being checked out by a veterinarian.
He spent the day sleeping in a tree high above his exhibit.
No one knows exactly how he got out, but he posed no danger to the public.
The exhibit has a Koala Cam, but Mundu's Houdini-like move was not caught on camera.
