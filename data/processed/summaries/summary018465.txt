Former Italy coach Arrigo Sacchi says his comments on black players were misunderstood.
Sacchi was quoted as saying there were "too many black players" in the country's youth ranks.
68-year-old led Italy to the 1994 World Cup final and won two European Champions League titles with Milan.
Sacchi: "I just said that we don't have the Italian pride, we are losing our identity.".
