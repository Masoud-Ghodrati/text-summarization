State media reports "race-hate" violence has erupted in Moscow and St. Petersburg.
About 5,000 Spartak Moscow supporters clashed with police last weekend.
They were protesting alleged police negligence over the death of Yegor Sviridov, 28.
Sviridov was reportedly killed in a fight with migrants from Russia's North Caucasus region.
