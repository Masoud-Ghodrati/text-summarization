Aaron Collins, 30, died on July 7 in a Lexington, Kentucky, hospital.
He left a will that asked that somebody leave "an awesome tip".
"I'm not talking about 25%. I mean $500 for a ... pizza," he wrote in his will.
A video of his family fulfilling his wish goes viral and raises thousands of dollars.
