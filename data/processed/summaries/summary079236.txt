Secretary of State Kerry is on his first official trip to Canada.
He has a message for terrorist groups, and efforts to thwart their recruiting.
No place is safe for those who "pervert the teachings of a great religion, murder the innocent".
Kerry pledges the U.S. will work "even more closely" with Canada to prevent terrorism.
