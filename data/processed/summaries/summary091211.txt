Rachel Gold, 28, worked in recruiting; Anthony Barberio, 46, worked on Wall Street.
Despite their differences, both are looking for jobs after being laid off last year.
They are using social networking sites, online searches, recruiters and blogs.
Hundreds of applications have resulted in few leads, but both see reasons for hope.
