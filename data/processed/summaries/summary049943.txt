William Riley Knight had stopped to help a woman whose vehicle had slid into a ditch.
He and Linda Darlington were struck multiple times as they stood by the side of the road.
Knight's new wife was waiting in the car when the accident happened.
"We have a job to do here, but sometimes it just brings you sadness," a spokeswoman says.
