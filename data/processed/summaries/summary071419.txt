Train in West Bengal kills three elephants and left one in a critical condition.
The train plowed into the animals as the herd crossed the tracks.
As many as 36 elephants have been killed by trains in the area since 2004.
India has a wild population of some 25,000 Asiatic elephants but their habitat is under threat.
