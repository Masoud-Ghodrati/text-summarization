Court finds the Dutch state liable in the deaths of more than 300 Bosnian Muslim men.
It says Dutch peacekeepers should not have let the men be taken away by Bosnian Serbs.
The Mothers of Srebrenica group brought the case against the Dutch state.
Nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995.
