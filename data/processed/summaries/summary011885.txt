Origami crane, made by girl that inspired a nation, is now on display at 9/11 center.
Sadako Sasaki survived the Hiroshima bombing; made origami in hopes of beating leukemia.
Her brother recently donated an original crane as message of peace.
"Even in death, we're going to carry on that little girl's wish," center's co-founder says.
