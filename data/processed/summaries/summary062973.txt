Mississippi jury convicts Carla Hughes of two counts of capital murder on Tuesday.
Avis Banks was five months pregnant when she was shot and stabbed in 2006.
Prosecutors said Hughes killed so she could be with Banks' fiance, Keyon Pittman.
Hughes and Pittman were teachers at Chastain Middle School in Jackson.
