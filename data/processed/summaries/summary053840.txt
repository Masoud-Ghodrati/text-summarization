President Obama is to give a speech in Berlin on transatlantic alliance.
It comes on the eve of anniversary of JFK's famous Berlin speech.
Kennedy used the occasion to signal his solidarity with people of West Berlin.
Nicolaus Mills says JFK's overriding point was: When one is enslaved, all of us are not free.
