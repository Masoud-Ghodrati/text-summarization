Donny and Marie Osmond think many young entertainers today "just jump into the business".
Duo is inspired by legends like Elvis Presley, who took his job as an entertainer seriously.
Marie Osmond recently remarried her first husband after 29 years.
Donny, meanwhile, calls his 33-year marriage "the only thing that kept me sane".
