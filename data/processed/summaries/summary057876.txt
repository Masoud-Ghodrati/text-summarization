French DJ Guetta says electro music has a long way to go before it's as successful as Hip Hop, an urban genre.
In July, 180,000 music fans massed on the small Belgian town of 'Boom' for the Tomorrowland festival.
Tomorrowland already has 4 million social media followers and over 80 million people watched the after-movie.
