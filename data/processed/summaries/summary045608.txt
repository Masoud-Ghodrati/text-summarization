Radovan Karadzic appears at hearing at International Criminal Tribunal to discuss his refusal to appear for war crimes trial.
Ex-Bosnian Serb leader is accused of responsibility for worst massacre in Europe since World War II.
Karadzic, who is representing himself, says he has had insufficient time to prepare his defense.
Karadzic was arrested last year in Belgrade after more than a decade on the run.
