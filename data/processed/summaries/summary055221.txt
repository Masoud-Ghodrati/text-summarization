Mitch Gilbert found two envelopes, each containing $5,000, at Las Vegas airport.
He waited for someone to come looking for it, and checked back two weeks later.
He recently returned the money to an El Paso, Texas, man who had lost it.
"I wanted to show my kids the right thing to do," the Colorado man says.
