NEW: The boy's father doesn't think McCready will bring the child to Florida.
"The child is now an official missing person," a child welfare spokeswoman says.
The order gives law enforcement the right to go anywhere to pick up the child, 5.
McCready has visitation rights but does not have legal custody of the boy.
