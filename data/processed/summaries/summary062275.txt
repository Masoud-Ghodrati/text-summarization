Marc Randazza says he can't stand Rush Limbaugh but will defend his right to be heard.
He says the First Amendment doesn't require politeness; it requires right to express ideas.
He says Limbaugh draws millions to hear his views. That's not "in the public interest?".
Randazza: Debate Limbaugh in the marketplace of ideas; discredit him, don't silence him.
