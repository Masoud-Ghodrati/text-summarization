Marco Simoncelli claims pole position for the first time in a MotoGP event.
Italian rider heads off Casey Stoner to earn first place on grid for Sunday's race.
He had been warned after causing an accident in Le Mans a fortnight ago.
That incident saw Dani Pedrosa break his collarbone and miss his home race in Spain.
