British weightlifter Zoe Smith fulfilled a dream by competing in London Olympics.
The 19-year-old broke a British record in the clean and jerk during the Games.
She has fought stereotypes of weightlifters who are called "butch" or "lesbians".
Smith says the noise that greeted her display in London was similar to a rock concert.
