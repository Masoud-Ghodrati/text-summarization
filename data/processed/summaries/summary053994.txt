J.R. Martinez was severely burned while serving as a soldier in Iraq at 19.
During recovery, he helped another young man in the same situation, which changed his life.
People don't understand that the feeling of helping others is "what's in it for them".
To start helping others, do what you do best, make them feel appreciated, Martinez says.
