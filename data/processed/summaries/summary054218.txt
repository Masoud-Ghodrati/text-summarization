The British Museum says it is lending one of the Elgin Marbles to a foreign museum for the first time.
The sculpture of the river god Ilissos will go on display at Russia's Hermitage Museum.
The Elgin Marbles are a set of Parthenon sculptures "acquired" by Lord Elgin in the early 1800s.
For decades, Greece has been demanding for their return.
