Bernie Ecclestone says recent criticism of F1 legend Michael Schumacher is "unfair".
The German driver is yet to win a race since his return to the sport with Mercedes this season.
Championship leader Lewis Hamilton suggested Schumacher is too old to compete at top.
Seven-time world champion, 41, says he has a long-term project at Mercedes.
