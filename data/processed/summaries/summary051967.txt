Osama bin Laden was 43 when he married an 18-year-old Yemen woman in 2000.
Amal al-Sadah became his fifth wife, and they had a daughter shortly after 9/11.
She comes from a big, respectable, conservative family in Yemen, a relative tells CNN.
Her family didn't have any ties to al Qaeda prior to the marriage, the relative says.
