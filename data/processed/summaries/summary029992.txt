A federal grand jury indicted Irek Ilgiz Hamidullin for 2009 attack on an Afghan base.
Hamidullin is a Russian citizen who allegedly fought for the Taliban and Haqqani network.
He faces 12 charges, including terror support and attempted murder of a U.S. citizen.
"This is very unusual," a legal expert says of the case.
