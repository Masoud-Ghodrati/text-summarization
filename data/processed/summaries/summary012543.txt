Jonathan Walton: Bishop Long never directly refuted allegations of seducing teen boys.
Walton says those trying to deflect a perjury charge use the cowardly rhetoric Long used.
Long hid behind biblical metaphors, he writes, used congregation as shield.
Walton believes if the bishop wants authority, he needs to take responsibility.
