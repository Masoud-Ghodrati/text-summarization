Lawyer and activist Salwa Bugaighis was shot, stabbed in her Benghazi home June 25.
Bugaighis' husband is thought to have been at home during the attack and is now listed missing.
Libyans from across the country took to social media, sharing their shock, grief, and anger.
Bugaighis had earlier urged Libyans to vote in their second parliamentary poll since 2011.
