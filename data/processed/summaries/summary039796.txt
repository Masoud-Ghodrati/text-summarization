The European air safety agency has ordered safety checks for all Airbus A380s after cracks were found in the wings.
The A380 can potentially carry more than 800 passengers and is said by an industry expert to be a very quiet aircraft.
Its main rival is the Boeing 747-8 which is also claimed to be quiet and efficient.
Airbus says it has found a "repair solution".
