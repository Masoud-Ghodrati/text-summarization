Nico Rosberg wins Chinese Grand Prix, 30 years after father Keke won Swiss Grand Prix.
He is the third son of an F1 driver to win a race, following the Hills and Villeneuves.
Win is Nico's 111th race, hopefully paving the way for more victories.
Nico's Finnish father was able to celebrate his win, unlike Graham Hill and Gilles Villeneuve.
