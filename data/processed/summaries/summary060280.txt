NEW: There are conflicting reports as to when the castaway and his companion disappeared.
Jose Salvador Alvarenga turned up in the Marshall Islands last week in a small boat.
He claims to have been adrift for about 13 months after setting off from Mexico.
Alvarenga says he lived off fish, birds, turtles, rainwater and urine while adrift.
