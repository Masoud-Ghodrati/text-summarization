Jeremy Clarkson asks forgiveness for using the n-word on a shoot.
The "Top Gear" host mumbled the word while reciting a nursery rhyme; it wasn't aired.
He says he did everything in his power to ensure that the footage was not used.
BBC: "We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this".
