The FBI says Darrell Mathis sold marijuana to federal agents during a 4-month probe.
Mathis turned up in his patrol car, in uniform, for some sales.
The investigation began with a "social visit," court papers state.
Mathis could not be reached for comment; he could face up to life in prison if found guilty.
