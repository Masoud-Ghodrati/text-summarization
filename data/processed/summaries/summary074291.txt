Vatican spokesman: Pope Benedict XVI pardons his former butler, Paolo Gabriele.
Gabriele was given an 18-month prison term in October for aggravated theft.
He was convicted after leaking private papers from the pope's apartment.
The papers informed a book that revealed corruption claims within the Church hierarchy.
