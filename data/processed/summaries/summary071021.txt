Nigel Mansell is the only driver to hold F1 and IndyCar titles at the same time.
He pulled off the feat in 1993 after quitting Formula One to drive in the U.S..
The 60-year-old will be a race steward at this weekend's U.S. Grand Prix.
He says modern F1 drivers are not "crazy enough" to try American cars.
