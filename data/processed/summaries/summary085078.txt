In Russia there is a great respect for the heritage of ballet.
Mikhailovsky Theatre's new Artistic Director is Nacho Duato.
Duato is the first foreigner to lead a major dance company in Russia for over a century ago.
There is a great debate over the merits of contemporary ballet versus those of the classics.
