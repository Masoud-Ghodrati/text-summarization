Reuse of syringes costs an estimated 1.3 million lives a year, Marc Koska says.
Syringes can spread blood-borne diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, he says.
Koska says low-cost syringes that can be used only once are produced.
He says India has mandated use of auto-disable syringes in government facilities.
