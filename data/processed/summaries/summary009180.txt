James Brown, 24, is charged and held on $1 million bond in Michigan, police say.
The counts are tied to an investigation into the deaths of four women.
They posted online ads for escort services before their deaths, police say.
Their bodies were found in Detroit; the police chief says they likely died elsewhere.
