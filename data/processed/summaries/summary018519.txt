A stunning art collection confiscated from Cornelius Gurlitt has been returned to him.
He has agreed to return works to their owners if it's proven they were stolen by the Nazis.
Gurlitt says he inherited the collection from his father and was unaware any were suspect.
The huge art trove was found in his Munich apartment by German tax authorities in 2012.
