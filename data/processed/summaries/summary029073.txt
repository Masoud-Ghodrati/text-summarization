Rory McIlroy says losing his No. 1 spot to Tiger Woods could help him return to form.
Woods regained the top ranking with his eighth career win at Bay Hill Invitational.
McIlroy aims to play his way into form at the Houston Open this weekend.
Victory would return the 23-year-old to top spot ahead of next month's Masters.
