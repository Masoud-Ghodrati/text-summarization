Marrabenta is the distinctive national music of Mozambique.
Originally played with tin-can guitars at gatherings, it combines Portuguese folk with Mozambican dance rhythms.
Neyma, one of the genre's most popular artists, had the best selling album of the year in Mozambique in 2013.
A derivative genre called Pandza is also gaining popularity among the country's youth.
