A new study claims the ruins at Petra, Jordan were built to align with the sun during the solstices and equinoxes.
Despite the breadth of the ruins, only 85% have ever been excavated.
Little is known about the function of many of Petra's structures.
The study's leader hopes his findings will shed new light on how Petra functioned.
