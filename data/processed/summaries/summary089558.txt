JetBlue pilot Clayton Osbon began behaving erratically on a March 27 flight, authorities say.
His copilot locked him out of the cockpit, and several passengers subdued him.
He is charged with one count of interfering with a flight crew.
The indictment says he knowingly interfered with the crew and was disruptive.
