Guadalupe Arizpe De La Vega opened a hospital in Juarez, Mexico, 30 years ago.
With violence plaguing the streets of Juarez, the hospital is more important now than ever.
De La Vega's nonprofit organization ensures people are treated even if they can't pay.
De La Vega, 74, lives in El Paso, Texas, but still travels to Juarez several times a week.
