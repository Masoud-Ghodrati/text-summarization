NEW: Passengers report being confined to seats on aircraft, more patdowns before boarding.
"We ask that passengers follow the instructions of international security and flight crews," TSA says.
An official with the TSA told CNN that screening likely will take longer.
No changes in screening requirements, and no change in the number of carry-on bags allowed.
