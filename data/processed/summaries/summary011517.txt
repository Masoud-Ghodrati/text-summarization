John Edwards' ex-mistress had sued his former aide for invasion of privacy.
A settlement between them was reached and signed Thursday by a N.C. judge.
Copies of a sex tape showing the ex-mistress and Edwards will be destroyed.
The aide and his wife admit no liability, and there is no monetary settlement.
