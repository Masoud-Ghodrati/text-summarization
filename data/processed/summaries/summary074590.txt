James Fergusson: Somali teens lured into Al-Shabaab by promise of food, security.
Many are orphans, he says, with no real Islamic ideology, who want to survive.
Recruiters tell of virgins in heaven, he says; Americans lured by tales of battle.
He says until Somalia gives teens a chance at a decent life, they will turn to Al-Shabaab.
