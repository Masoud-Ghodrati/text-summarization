NASA is studying the possibility of sending a manned mission into the relatively benign atmosphere of Venus.
The concept involves sending an aeroshell that would contain a folded helium airship in the planet's atmosphere.
At 30 miles above the planet's surface, the gravity, atmosphere and radiation protection is similar to that of Earth.
The space agency says the mission could involve creating a floating blimp city for a permanent manned presence.
