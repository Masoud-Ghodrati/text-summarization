Carey Goldberg says study shows marriage statistics down but rate of unmarried moms up.
She says she'd bought sperm to have baby, then met man who agreed to reproduce with her.
She says they had ups, downs, split, got back together, had another baby and got married.
Goldberg tells her daughter: It's fine to stay single, but marriage is one of the best things in life.
