Timothy Stanley says Margaret Thatcher was a paradox as a radical conservative.
He says she upended Britain's post-war trajectory, cut taxes and increased privatization.
She made country aspirational but demonized opponents and stoked class warfare, he says.
Stanley: As woman, she broke ground; as PM, she was important but divisive figure.
