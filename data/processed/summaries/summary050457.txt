Wang Lijun in February sought asylum in a U.S. Consulate, sparking a political crisis.
He is charged with defection, bribe-taking, abusing his power and covering up a murder.
Wang, 52, was a right-hand man of prominent politician Bo Xilai, a fallen political leader.
He "is probably the most hated" figure among Beijing leadership for going to the Americans.
