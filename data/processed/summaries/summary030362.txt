Women and children are among the refugees who walk across border to Jordan.
Families were shot at and people injured while trying to cross, Jordan Border Guard says.
Refugees walk for hours or days, carrying what they can, to escape civil war.
Jordan's resources are taxed, and winter "makes it even more difficult," border official says.
