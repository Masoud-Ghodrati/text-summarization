Scaffolding collapsed around an Indiana State Fair stage, killing 7 and injuring dozens.
Victims and kin of those killed agree to a $50 million settlement in the case.
A separate case against a security company working the fair is continuing, law firm says.
Earlier reports found the scaffolding wasn't up to par; emergency plans were inadequate.
