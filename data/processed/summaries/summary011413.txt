Police think gunman was carrying a camera, a Belgian law enforcement official says.
Investigators do not believe the attack was a "hit" targeting an Israeli couple who were killed.
"We believe they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time," says official.
Police are struggling to identify the shooter from footage because he wore a baseball cap.
