Witnesses say Jason Russell ran along a street in his underwear, screaming.
His behavior is "in no way the result of drugs or alcohol in his body," family says.
Russell founded Invisible Children, which made the film about warlord Joseph Kony.
His "Kony 2012" video has nearly 85 million YouTube views.
