In an affidavit, an FBI agent details accusations in an Ohio forced labor case.
A mother and her daughter were held captive and repeatedly threatened, the affidavit says.
The mother tells investigators pit bulls got leftovers while she and her daughter went hungry.
One witness says he saw a suspect point guns at the mother's head.
