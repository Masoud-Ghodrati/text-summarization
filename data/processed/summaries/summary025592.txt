NEW: China expresses its support for U.N. condemnation but wants a muted reaction.
The meeting Tuesday is a response to North Korea's nuclear test last month.
The United States and China have been in talks on a proposed resolution.
The nuclear test followed a previous U.N. resolution broadening sanctions.
