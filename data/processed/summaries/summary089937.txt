A British report suggests Kenya suspect Jermaine Grant knew one of the 7/7 bombers.
Grant served jail time with Jermaine Lindsay, who took part in the attack on London, it says.
Grant, from Britain, is on trial in Kenya accused of planning an attack on Mombasa.
He's accused of working alongside Lindsay's widow, Samantha Lewthwaite.
