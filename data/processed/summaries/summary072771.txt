Heidi Ewing: People in Detroit always talk about how pretty, how lively, things used to be.
Ewing grew up in suburbs, but she loved the snapshots of her parents in 1960s Detroit.
She wanted to film the "comeback city," but found desperate people on the margins.
Ewing decided to turn camera on the folks who stayed to bring Detroit back to its vibrant past.
