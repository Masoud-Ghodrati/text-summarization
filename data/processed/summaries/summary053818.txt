At least 55 deaths from extra-tropical cyclone, 45 of them in France.
High winds -- at times spiking to 200 km/h (124 mph) -- reached as far as Paris.
"Many people drowned, surprised by the rapid rise of the water," French official says.
Deaths also reported in Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Germany and England.
