Theater critic Kevin Williamson is sick of rude audiences who talk or text during plays.
A woman sitting next to him wouldn't stop using her phone, so he took it and threw it.
She slapped him; he was kicked out. But he's glad he did it, calls it an act of criticism.
In part he blames managers who let people in late and don't stop distracting behavior.
