NEW: Episcopal Church on Saturday consecrated its first openly lesbian bishop.
The Rev. Mary Glasspool, 56, is now a bishop in the Los Angeles diocese.
Conservatives in the Anglican Communion have opposed gay bishops' ordinations.
Glasspool and Rev. Diane Bruce are the diocese's first two women elected to bishop.
