The anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s death coincides this year with Easter.
Eddie Glaude says the martyred preacher spoke about the message of Easter.
King said Easter shows that death does not have the last word, according to Glaude.
King challenged people to fight for social justice, and said love is the "most durable power in the world".
