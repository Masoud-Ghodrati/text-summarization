Peter Bergen: The announcement of links between Syrian insurgents, al Qaeda is worrying.
He says it gives al Qaeda an opportunity to demonstrate that it is still relevant.
The insurgent group, al-Nusra, is the most effective of the rebel groups in Syria, he says.
Bergen: The Obama administration has been right to move deliberately on aid to rebels.
