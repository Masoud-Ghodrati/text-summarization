U.N. envoy Robert Serry, a group of Palestinian Christians proceed through the Old City.
A woman says the group wants to get into church "to pray"; Israeli police block them.
Serry says he's dismayed, urges respect for "religious freedom," no "provocations".
An Israeli official tells a newspaper police were limiting the crowd, calling it a "non-event".
