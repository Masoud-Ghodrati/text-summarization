Edward Morrissey says Obama jobs speech reminded him of film "Groundhog Day".
He says speech was retread of jobs plans in the 2009 stimulus plan.
He says Obama vows everything will be paid for, but will let Congress figure out how.
Morrissey: Strategies like extending jobless benefits and payroll tax cuts are stale.
