Sonny Bill Williams is hoping to be first player to win World Cups in both rugby codes.
He was the first Muslim to play for New Zealand's All Blacks, winning 2011 world title.
Williams is part of NZ Kiwis team which has reached final of Rugby League World Cup.
He says becoming a Muslim has helped him become content and more assured.
