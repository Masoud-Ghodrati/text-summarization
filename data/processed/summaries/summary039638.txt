Dean Obeidallah says the administration has done a poor job of explaining Obamacare.
He says the plan has many popular features, but the public doesn't fully understand it.
A failure to explain has left room for Republicans to distort it, he says.
Obeidallah: Administration has belatedly moved to tout the benefits of Obamacare.
