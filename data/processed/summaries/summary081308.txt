Bob Greene says years from now, many may not remember 9/11. Will the war even be over?.
He says remembrances are moving but can't be expected to bring resolution to attacks.
He says World War II ended with a surrender; no such thing is expected in this war.
Greene: On Monday U.S. will still be wishing for tranquillity, even as event fades into history.
