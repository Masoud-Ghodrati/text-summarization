Roland Martin says Tea Party spokesman claimed civil rights high ground in recent debate.
Tea Party's criticism of NAACP would surprise civil rights groups, he says.
He challenges Tea Party to address racial profiling, education, "don't ask, don't tell".
Martin: Tea Partiers have talked the talk on civil rights, now they should walk the walk.
