NEW: John Anthony Downey appears in court charged with a 1982 London bombing.
He is accused of the murders of four cavalry members.
The cavalry members and 7 horses were killed as they traveled through Hyde Park.
"There is sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction," said prosecutors.
