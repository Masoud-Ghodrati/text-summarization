BP decided to suspend dividends for rest of year as it creates escrow fund for liability.
Dorothy Brown says it's impossible to say how much liability BP will have for oil leak.
She says bulk of dividends go to people who have high income.
Investors in oil company that drills offshore assume risk, she says.
