Marissa Alexander fired a gun in the air when her abusive husband threatened her.
No one was hurt, but she faces 20 years in prison on various charges.
Alexander: "Had I not discharged my weapon at that point, I would not be here".
She hopes the case will be dismissed under the 'stand your ground' law.
