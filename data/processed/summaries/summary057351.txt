"I just want to know who I am," girl says, according to children's services agency.
She's described as 5', 6" tall, "very soft-spoken"; doctors say she's 14 to 17 years old.
Girl was found in midtown Manhattan early October 9 outside youth shelter.
Agency says girl recently wrote down the name "Amber" and has responded to it.
