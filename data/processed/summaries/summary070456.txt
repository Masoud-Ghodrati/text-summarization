Police say Paul Bradley forced a friend's wife to attempt a bank robbery.
"I had coffee with him all last week," her husband said.
The woman told tellers she had a bomb strapped to her ankle when she went in.
Their assailant wore a mask and said little, so they were unable to identify their attacker at first.
