Seen as the birthplace of Jesus, Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity is one of Christianity's holiest sites.
It has been nominated to be declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO.
If approved, it will become the first Palestinian inclusion on the list.
Palestinian membership to UNESCO was granted last October.
