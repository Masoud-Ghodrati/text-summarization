Hamas has used tunnels to stage attacks in Israel and Gaza, the Israeli military says.
The military has destroyed some tunnels, but says it believes there are many more.
Hamas used a tunnel to capture an Israeli soldier in 2006.
A tunnel into Israel discovered last year showed increasing sophistication.
