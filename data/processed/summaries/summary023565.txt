Hong Kong protest leader Joshua Wong accuses police of excessive force against him.
He says he was kicked, punched and his genitals grabbed during his arrest.
Wong was charged with obstructing officers clearing the Mong Kok protest site.
Student leaders are now calling on protesters to focus on two other protest sites in the city.
