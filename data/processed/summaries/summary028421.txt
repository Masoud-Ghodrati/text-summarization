John Chadima resigned after the allegations surfaced.
Chadima was the senior associate athletic director at the University of Wisconsin.
After the sexual advance, Chadima threatened to have the student fired, the report says.
"I make no excuses and accept full responsibility," Chadima said in a written statement.
