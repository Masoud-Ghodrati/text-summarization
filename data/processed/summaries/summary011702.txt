Sean Callebs suffers from panic attacks that began after he saw an electric chair execution.
Callebs: In an attack, your heart races, you hyperventilate, you think you're about to die.
Callebs had to hide his attacks while he was reporting or even sitting in the anchor chair.
He is doing much better today after seeking help and not giving in to the fear.
