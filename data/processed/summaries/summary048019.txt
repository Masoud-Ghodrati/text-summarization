Ruben Navarrette: There is a new term to add to our national lexicon, "white Hispanic".
It's a label applied to George Zimmerman, who shot a black teenager, Navarrette says.
He says anyone, regardless of color, can be a racist whether white, Hispanic or black.
The media should have thought twice before turning to loaded term, Navarrette says.
