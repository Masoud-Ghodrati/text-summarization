The Italian magazine, Chi, says it will print photos of the Duchess of Cambridge on holiday.
The photos show her in "a small bikini that enhances her now visible (baby) bump," Chi says.
A disappointed St. James's Palace says the pics violate her privacy.
Chi was among the publications to run photos of Catherine sunbathing topless last year.
