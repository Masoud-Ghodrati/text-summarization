Dan Madigan says Catholic church has long had an answer on condom use: "Absolutely not".
He says pope surprised by saying prostitutes' condom use more morally responsible.
Church teaches: No sex outside marriage, no condoms; new comments aim at unmarried sex.
Madigan: Pope's comments reflect a more sophisticated strain of Catholic moral tradition.
