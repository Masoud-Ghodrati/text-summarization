A 41-year-old man is arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage, police say.
A portrait of Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey was defaced with paint.
The portrait, by Ralph Heimans, is being taken down until the damage can be remedied.
The abbey has been the site of the coronation of English kings and queens since 1066.
