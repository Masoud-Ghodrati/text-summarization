Red River was 17 feet above its flood stage in Fargo, North Dakota, on Friday afternoon.
River expected to crest this weekend, but not as high as last year's record 40.8 feet.
More than 1 million sandbags have been filled in Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota.
Despite flooding, Fargo mayor says, "we're in good shape today".
