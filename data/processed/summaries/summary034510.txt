More than 4,000 people have been stuck on the Carnival Triumph for five days.
Carnival Cruise Lines opted to tow it, rather than move passengers to another ship.
Strong currents prompted the company to change where the ship would dock.
The journey home was delayed for four hours Thursday because of tugboat trouble.
