Businessman and stockbroker Mark Hotton is arrested at his Long Island home.
Authorities say he created fake investors to fool producers of "Rebecca: The Musical,".
Hotton promised the show a $4.5 million investment from four overseas investors, officials say.
When pressed, he said one investor had died of malaria, authorities say.
