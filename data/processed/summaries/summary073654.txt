India's Supreme Court has temporarily banned ecotourism in the country's tiger parks.
Environmentalists says the tourism has hurt the tigers' ability to reproduce.
Those in the tourism industry say the state needs to better regulate the parks.
Animal rights activists believe poaching could increase if tourists leave the parks.
