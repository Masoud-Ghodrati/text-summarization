Sweden has a tradition of Eurovision success, having won the contest four times.
It selects its entry each year through a televised national song contest called "Melodifestivalen".
The show is the highest rated program in Swedish history, more popular than Eurovision.
Sweden's 2012 entry, "Euphoria" by Loreen, was the bookies' favorite to win.
