Polgar became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15, taking title from Bobby Fischer.
She is the only women ranked in World Chess Federation's top 100 players.
Birth of first child forced Polgar to reassess: "Everything really fell apart".
Now she balances professional chess with writing, motherhood and marriage.
