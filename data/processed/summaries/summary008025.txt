"42" is a new movie about Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in baseball.
20 years ago, Mike Downey was hired to write the script for a Jackie Robinson biopic.
After constant squabbling, rewrites and interference, he and co-writer were fired.
Downey: After many starts and stops over years, the film is out, thanks to Robinson's widow.
