Death of Iranian spiritual leader is a blow to Iran's reform movement, says Nader Hashemi.
He says Ayatollah Montazeri stood up for the rights of protesters.
Montazeri helped pave the way for Islamic Republic but turned against it, Hashemi says.
He says Montazeri apologized for seizure of U.S. Embassy and defended the persecuted Baha'is.
