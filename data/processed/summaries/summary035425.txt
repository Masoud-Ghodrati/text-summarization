George Zimmerman is charged with murder in the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin.
A judge revoked his $150,000 bond after saying Zimmerman and his wife lied about finances.
Zimmerman's defense wanted the judge out for his "gratuitous, disparaging" language.
The judge denied the defense request that he step down, calling it "legally insufficient".
