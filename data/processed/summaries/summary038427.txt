Tetris, the addictive building-block video game, turns 25 this month.
CNN speaks with Alexey Pajitnov, the game's creator, about its popularity.
Last year, 10 percent of all games on mobile phones in the U.S. were Tetris.
Pajitnov: "It's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it".
