Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda appoints Katsuya Okada, a former party leader, as his deputy.
Okada is expected to lead efforts to push through an unpopular increase in the sales tax.
Noda also names new defense and consumer affairs ministers after opposition pressure.
The prime minister is already facing sagging approval numbers four months into his tenure.
