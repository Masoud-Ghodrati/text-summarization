James Beard "Outstanding Chef" Tom Colicchio: Fine restaurants aren't snobbish.
He says don't expect piles of food, just high-quality food at upscale restaurants.
"Best Service" winner chef Grant Achatz says cuisine is challenging, not the staff.
He says giggles are OK: "Relax. You're here to have a good time".
