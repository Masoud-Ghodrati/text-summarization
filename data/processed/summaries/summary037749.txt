Ruben Navarrette: In the 2012 election, Mitt Romney was a backward voice on immigration.
He criticized Rick Perry, Newt Gingrich for ideas that helped immigrants, Navarrette says.
Navarrette: This year, Romney is wisely calling on GOP to pass immigration reform.
He says it's the one smart way Republicans can respond to Obama's executive action.
