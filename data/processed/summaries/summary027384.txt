French footballer Nicolas Anelka has caused a storm by using the "quenelle" gesture as a goal celebration.
The gesture was created by controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala.
The quenelle has been linked to rising anti-Semitism in France.
Figures from 2012 show a 59% rise in anti-Semitic attacks.
