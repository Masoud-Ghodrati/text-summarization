Marijuana activist Marc Emery sentenced for selling marijuana seeds to U.S. customers.
In plea deal with federal prosecutors, Emery admitted to operating seed-selling business.
Emery's lawyer, supporters, claim his prosecution was politically motivated.
"I regret not choosing other methods -- legal ones -- to achieve my goals," Emery says.
