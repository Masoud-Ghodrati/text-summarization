A decommissioned U.S. Navy warship was intentionally sunk off the Florida Keys.
The USNS Vandenberg will become the world's second-largest artificial reef.
The sunken ship will create a long-term habitat for scores of marine fish species.
The ship was built in 1943 and commissioned as a WWII troop transport ship.
