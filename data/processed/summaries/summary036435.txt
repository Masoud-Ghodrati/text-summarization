David Amaya Barrick, 37, will finally see his mother for the first time in about 35 years.
Their reunion will take place Saturday in San Diego's airport.
The estranged husband took the boy to Mexico when he was about 2 years old.
The mom was unable to find her son until the U.S. Border Patrol recently arrested him.
