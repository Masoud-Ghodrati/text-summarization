Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, is on trial in federal court.
He is accused of conspiring to kill U.S. nationals and being al Qaeda's propagandist.
On Wednesday, he took the stand in his defense.
He testifies he told bin Ladan, "America will not rest until it accomplishes two things".
