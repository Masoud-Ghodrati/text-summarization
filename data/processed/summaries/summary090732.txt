Around 49 million Americans are "food insecure," Department of Agriculture report says.
Canstruction has collected more than 25 million pounds of food for food banks since 1993.
Some sculpture projects use up to 7,000 cans of food.
Sculptures are later dismantled, and cans are donated to local food pantries.
