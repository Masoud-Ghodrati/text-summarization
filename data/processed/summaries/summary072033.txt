NEW: Abbas says there can be no peace deal until all prisoners have been freed.
The Palestinian Prison Authority says a total of 26 prisoners have been released.
It is the second time in recent months that Israel has freed prisoners.
The release is part of an agreement that jump-started stalled peace talks.
