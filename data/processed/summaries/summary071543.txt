Dennis Rodman leads a "Happy Birthday" singalong with crowds at a Pyongyang stadium.
His "basketball diplomacy" team loses to North Korean squad, state media reports.
"It was, as you might imagine, a bizarre and unusual occasion," a tour leader says.
Rodman angered many Tuesday by implying that a U.S. man held in North Korea is guilty.
