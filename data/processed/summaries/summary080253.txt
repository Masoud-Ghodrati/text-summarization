David Frakt: Seizure of Abu Anas al Libi being hailed as triumph for rule of law.
He says the situation isn't clear and it appears Libya government might not have been told.
Putting al-Libi on trial in regular court would be a good thing for rule of law, he says.
Frakt: Obama should resist calls to send him to Guantanamo and try him in military court.
