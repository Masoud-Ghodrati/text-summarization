Mel Robbins: After racist audio, NBA should publicly strip Donald Sterling of franchise rights.
She says the audio not yet authenticated, but Sterling trails racist history unchecked by NBA.
She says team showed outrage by altering uniforms; they should have boycotted game instead.
Robbins: There will be a lot of talk; what's needed is bold action. NBA, go big or go home.
