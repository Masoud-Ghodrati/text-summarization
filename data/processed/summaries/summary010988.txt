Edith Windsor: I never thought I would be an 83-year-old "out" lesbian suing the government.
She and Thea Spyer married in Canada, but DOMA means U.S. doesn't recognize it.
Windsor: DOMA is painful and wrong and Thea would want me to stand up for our marriage.
She says marriage equality would be "best possible final chapter in our love story".
