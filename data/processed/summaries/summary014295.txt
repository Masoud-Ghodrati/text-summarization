Officials tell families of missing students about the arrest after a day of protests.
Families reject official accounts and demand proof.
Cesar Nava Gonzalez had been on the run since the students disappeared, authorities say.
Nava allegedly helped round up the 43 students and hand them over to a drug gang.
