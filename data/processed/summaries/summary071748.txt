Texas Gov. Rick Perry calls second special session to address anti-abortion legislation.
A filibuster by state Sen. Wendy Davis thwarted first attempt to pass bill last week.
Critics say the bill will shut most of the state's abortion clinics.
Perry says "unprecedented anarchy" disrupted previous consideration of legislation.
