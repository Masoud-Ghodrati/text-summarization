It is 18 months since wonder horse Frankel retired from racing.
Jockey Tom Queally admits he will never ride another like the "Usain Bolt of racing".
Queally has visited Frankel just once but has moved on, targeting wins not horses.
Frankel's trainer Henry Cecil, who died last year, called him "the best I've ever seen".
