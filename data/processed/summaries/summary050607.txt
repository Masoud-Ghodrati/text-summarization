A Catholic elementary school principal is fired because of his writings on race.
Frank Borzellieri's topics included "the myth of integration" and "multicultural madness".
The New York Archdiocese says he was dismissed after his writings were reviewed.
The opinions were found to be "incompatible" with schools in the archdiocese.
