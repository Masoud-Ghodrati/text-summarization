U.S. luxury bridal designer Vera Wang's first store in China charging US$480 to try on clothes.
Fee was exclusive to Shanghai store, prompting cries of discrimination against Chinese.
Some speculated fee was intended to discourage copycat designs.
Vera Wang spokesperson said fee would be scrapped upon official opening of store in April.
