CNN obtained an internal DHS e-mail about a probe of the Federal Air Marshal Service.
E-mail: Probe found discrimination isn't "widespread," but many air marshals think it is.
Air marshals tell CNN they provided evidence of perjury, discrimination, other misconduct.
"We're going to tear the report apart," says air marshal who asked not to be identified.
