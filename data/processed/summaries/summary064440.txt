Officials say they found the wreckage of a plane believed to have been carrying Rivera.
"Everything points to that this is the plane," says the transportation minister.
Besides Rivera, two pilots and four other passengers were on board.
The plane lost contact with air traffic controllers outside Monterrey, Mexico.
