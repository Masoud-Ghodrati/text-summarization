Mitt Romney is trying to outdo President Obama in his support for Israel, says Amitai Etzioni.
It's a myth that the Jewish vote goes to whoever supports Israel more fervently, Etzioni says.
Only 4% of American Jews cite Israel as their most important voting issue, he says.
And 51% of those registered to vote cited the economy as the most important issue, he says.
