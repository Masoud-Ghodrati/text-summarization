Rep. Mark Kirk says GOP proposal would be far cheaper than Senate plan.
Plan keeps government out of "decisions made by you and your doctor," Kirk said.
Preliminary review of Senate plan finds it would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years.
Robert Gibbs says bill still being drafted; "has many twists and turns to go".
