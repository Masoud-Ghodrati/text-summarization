UK lawmakers vote to recognize Palestine as a state after a debate in Parliament.
The measure is mainly symbolic and is not binding on the government.
Motion says this would be "as a contribution to securing a negotiated two state solution".
It came 10 days after the new Swedish government said it would recognize Palestine.
