President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz was shot October 14, reportedly by his own troops.
While witnesses said it seemed an assassination try, he insisted it was an "accident".
He returns to Nouakchott from France, where he'd been recovering from injuries.
Throngs of supporters greet him, as he rolls through city streets in a convertible.
