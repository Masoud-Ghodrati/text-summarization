Jeremy Carl: Narendra Modi's victory in India can teach U.S. Republicans some lessons.
He says Modi was able to gain a majority in a complex nation of 1.2 billion people.
Modi focused on the economy and expanded his party's appeal to wider base, he says.
Carl: Modi didn't let media define him and made skillful use of social media.
