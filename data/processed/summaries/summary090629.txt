Doors' keyboardist Manzarek died at age 74 in May following a battle with bile duct cancer.
Guitarist Robby Krieger says he's been in touch with drummer John Densmore since then.
Krieger: "Not sure when or where it will be, but we'll definitely do it".
The fourth member of the original band, Jim Morrison, died in 1971.
