Bletchley Park was the home of British code-breaking during World War II.
The National Museum of Computing based at the Bletchley estate launched a new exhibit on women in computing.
Bletchley's fascinating history only became public several decades after the war ended.
Women made up majority of the 10,000 people who worked at secret code-breaking operation.
