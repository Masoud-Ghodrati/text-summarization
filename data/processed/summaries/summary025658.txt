Mohamed Abdikadir Mohamed was target of raid Saturday by U.S. Navy SEALs, officials say.
The Al-Shabaab commander, also called Ikrima, is thought to have escaped.
He's wanted by Kenya and its Western allies, accused of involvement in terror plots.
He's suspected of leading efforts to recruit and train foreigners for Al-Shabaab.
