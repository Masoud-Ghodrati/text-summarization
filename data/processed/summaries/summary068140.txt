Alan Furst, known as the master of the historical spy novel, has a new thriller, "Mission to Paris".
'"Mission to Paris" features an actor/spy caught up in pre-World War II intrigue.
Paris is a recurring locale in Furst's novels.
"There are things (from the 1930s) that are just like now," Furst says.
