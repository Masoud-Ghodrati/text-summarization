I literally owe my life to Phil Everly, and his older brother Don, writes Hawkins.
Hawkins' parents had split up, but were reconciled thanks to an Everly Brothers track.
Phil Everly, one half of the groundbreaking duo, died aged 74 in September.
Their hits included "Bye Bye Love" and "Cathy's Clown".
