Savile used his celebrity to "hide in plain sight" and targeted the vulnerable, police say.
He is accused of offenses across 40 years while working as a BBC presenter.
Police say 73% of his victims were children; 214 crimes are recorded, including rapes.
Prosecutors say police could have done more to investigate Savile in his lifetime.
