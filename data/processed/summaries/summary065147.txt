A German policeman is accused of murdering and dismembering a man.
The 55-year-old policeman met the victim on a cannibalism website, police say.
The victim, 59, reportedly "had been fantasizing about being killed and eaten since his youth".
The policeman is believed to have killed the man at a house and buried his body parts.
