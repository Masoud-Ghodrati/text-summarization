Prince Harry's visit to Angola echoes one made by his mother shortly before her 1997 death.
The prince's private visit is in support of the Halo Trust, an international demining charity.
He will meet demining teams, tour minefields and meet those helped by the trust's work.
Prince Harry's visit will include a stop in the heavily-mined town of Cuito Cuanavale.
