Pentagon to upgrade its stealth aircraft for first time since 1970s, developing a classified, next-generation bomber.
Air Force plans to award contract to build Long Range Strike Bomber later this year.
Air Force suggested it will offer a "cost-plus" contract, meaning government takes on risk of any cost overrun.
Indications are that new bomber will carry conventional and nuclear weapons and could possibly operate with or without a pilot.
