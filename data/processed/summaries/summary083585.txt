Masters of a southern Chinese style of kung fu have published the first manual in English.
The style known as Hung Kuen emphasises strong foundation stances and footwork.
Lam Chun-fai Sifu is a direct descendant of kung fu legend Wong Fei Hung.
He says the manual will help save the martial art - which has more foreign practitioners - from extinction.
