Royal correspondent Robert Jobson says Hilary Mantel's attack on Catherine is a venomous publicity stunt.
People who meet Kate warm to her. She has a winning smile and easy charm, says Robson.
Robson: I am surprised someone of Mantel's stature has joined in attacking Kate for no reason.
She has abused her position among the novel-writing elite to launch this attack, he says.
