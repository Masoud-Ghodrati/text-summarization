NEW: Two of the Japanese lawmakers on the list of those leaving say they are staying.
The departing parliamentarians are led by the influential Ichiro Ozawa.
They say they are protesting the prime minister's plan to double the sales tax.
It leaves the government with 251 out of 480 seats in the lower house.
