Rutgers student Tyler Clementi committed suicide last week, his family says.
Two other students are charged with broadcasting Clementi in a sexual encounter.
The president of Rutgers says, "We don't have all the facts in this case".
If true, the actions "gravely violate the university's standards of decency and humanity".
