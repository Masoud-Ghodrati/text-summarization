Saudi communications regulation agency threatens to block apps like Skype, WhatsApp.
Agency says the apps must comply with rules, but doesn't say what rules they're breaking.
Reports last week said telecoms were asked to let government monitor communications.
A Saudi blogger says the move may be because the apps are used to organize protests.
