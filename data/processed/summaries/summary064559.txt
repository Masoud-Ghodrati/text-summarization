Bieber's neighbors could make a citizen's arrest, a police spokesman says.
Over the weekend, Beverly Hills police were called to Bieber's building because of loud parties.
The singer moved to the condo after selling the home in an area where he egged neighbors.
Bieber is on two years' probation for vandalism against his neighbor.
