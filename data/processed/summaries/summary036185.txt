An anti-Gadhafi official predicts "drastic" changes soon in Sirte and Bani Walid.
He says loyalists no longer control parts of Sirte, Gadhafi's birthplace.
"Fierce fighting" is ongoing in the southwestern city of Sabha, he adds.
A "final call" is issued for pro-Gadhafi forces to switch or face "treason" charges.
