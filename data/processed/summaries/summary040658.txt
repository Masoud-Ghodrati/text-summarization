NEW: The Coast Guard says one of its ships should arrive at the cruise liner early Monday.
A fire occurs in the engine room of the Carnival Triumph on Sunday morning.
Afterward, the ship has no propulsion and now will need to be towed, the cruise line says.
No injuries reported; passengers and crew have food, water and electricity from generators.
