Keith Hasson, 45, was arrested Wednesday, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
He was placed on the Marshals Service's "15 Most Wanted" fugitives list on June 6.
He is reputed to be the leader of a drug ring that brought in more than $20 million.
Hasson was wanted on a 2005 open indictment from New Mexico.
