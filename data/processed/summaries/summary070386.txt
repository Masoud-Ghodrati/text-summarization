Lewis Beale: Slavery a stain on America, but few people want to know much about it.
He says it's essential to confront this past to understand how slavery's legacy is still with us.
The film "12 Years a Slave" is brutal, unstintingly realistic. Few movies have dared to be.
Beale: The film tells us how we got to where we are today racially. Will people watch?.
