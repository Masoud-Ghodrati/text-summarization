British-born Abdul Waheed Majeed carried out a suicide bomb attack on Aleppo prison.
His mother misses him and his elder brother says "his intentions were bona fide".
The soon-to-be bomber had sent his family pictures of him hard at work in tent camps.
According to his brother, Majeed never made a farewell phone call to his family.
