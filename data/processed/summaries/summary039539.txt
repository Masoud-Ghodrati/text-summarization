700 children are infected with HIV in sub-Saharan African daily.
Most mother-child transmission of HIV is preventable with drugs and education.
The Born Free charity is partnering with the fashion and beauty industries to raise funds.
Money raised will go toward the goal of ending mother-child transmission by 2015.
