The bamboo bicycle is increasing in popularity across Ghana and Africa.
Boomers International is a social enterprise creating bespoke bicycles whilst reducing youth unemployment.
The bamboo bicycles are uniquely designed to each customer meaning there is no replica anywhere in the world.
The company hope to expand to furniture, household items and houses made of bamboo.
