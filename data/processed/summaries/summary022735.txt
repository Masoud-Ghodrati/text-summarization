Ruben Navarrette: The deep divisions in the Republican Party are evident.
He says some Republicans emphasize social issues, such as opposition to gay marriage.
Others want to play down social issues, focus on the party's economic message, he says.
Navarrette: The only thing that unites GOP is a strong desire to defeat Obama's re-election bid.
