Gen. Russel Honoré: This disaster is the BP oil spill, not the Gulf oil spill.
BP should be fined, he says, even $100 million, each day the oil is gushing.
Money from fines should be used to help Gulf Coast and its people recover, Honoré says.
General believes BP and negligent government regulators should face jail time.
