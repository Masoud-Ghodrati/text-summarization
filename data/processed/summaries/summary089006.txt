South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford has vowed to refuse some of his state's share.
Sanford casts stimulus as exercise in printing money that doesn't exist to create jobs.
The governor compares it to Zimbabwe's 11 million percent inflation rate.
State legislatures can override governors and take stimulus money anyway.
