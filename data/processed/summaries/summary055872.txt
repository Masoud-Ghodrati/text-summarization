President Obama says withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq is on track.
Obama's view is that the war was not worth the loss of lives, money, says Fareed Zakaria.
Zakaria says costs outweighed the benefits of ousting Saddam Hussein.
He says Iraq hasn't yet had a genuine national reconciliation between key parties.
