Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare but sometimes fatal lung disease.
Hantavirus isn't communicable between people; symptoms include fever, aches and fatigue.
In the U.S, deer mice, cotton rats, rice rats and white-footed mice carry hantavirus.
Yosemite said Monday a second park visitor died after contracting the disease.
