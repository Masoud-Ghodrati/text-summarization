NEW: Two Japanese hospitalized in China due to radiation are "fine," a spokesman says.
High radiation is detected in Ibaraki Prefecture water; water safe in Tokyo, Chiba.
Radiation in seawater is 104 times above normal, a drop from the previous day.
An official says Japan will provide shuttles for those within 20-to-30 km of the plant.
