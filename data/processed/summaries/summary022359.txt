William Gale: Mitt Romney's $5 trillion tax cut proposal didn't add up for months.
He says new idea of a cap on deductions is a first step toward a viable plan.
Gale says the cap wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for the tax cuts, but it would help.
He says that it could make taxpayers much less likely to give to charity.
