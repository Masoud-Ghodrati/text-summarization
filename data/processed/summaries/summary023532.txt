NEW: A Chinese icebreaker is about 15 miles (24 kilometers) away from the vessel.
The first of three ice-breaking rescue ships should reach trapped vessel by Friday.
"Between the three of them, we're hoping to get out relatively quickly," leader says.
"Everyone is fine, the vessel is safe," expedition leader tells CNN via Skype.
