An appeals court remanded the case of a Guatemalan woman seeking asylum in the U.S..
Perdomo argues that because of high murder rates for women, she is not safe going home.
Ruling could affect other Guatemalan women in the United States.
A key issue is whether being a woman constitutes a protected social group.
