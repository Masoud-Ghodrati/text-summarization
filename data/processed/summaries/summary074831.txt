Jay Silver is a leading proponent of "maker movement," the do-it-yourself culture of inventing.
His MaKey MaKey kits let anyone turn everyday objects into computer interfaces.
Silver: "I think when you make something, you're kind of making meaning and purpose".
Silver spoke recently at PopTech, an idea-driven conference in Camden, Maine.
