A new app, Fixed, will contest parking tickets on a driver's behalf.
Users submit a photo of their ticket and the app handles the legal paperwork.
If Fixed gets someone out of a ticket, it charges them 25% of the ticket fine.
Fixed is rolling out in San Francisco first but hopes to expand to more cities.
