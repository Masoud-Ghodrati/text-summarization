Belgian MPs may allow terminally ill children and those with dementia access to euthanasia.
Pro-euthanasia advocate Dr. Philip Nitschke says debate must avoid moral panic, dogma.
Nitschke: If a patient's suffering cannot be relieved, what should the State do?.
"I hope no one I love will ever need to use such laws, but draw comfort from them".
