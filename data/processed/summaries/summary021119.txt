NEW: The convicted doctor is at peace knowing now "what his fate is," his lawyer says.
Kermit Gosnell, 72, was convicted Monday on three counts of first-degree murder.
He gives up his right to appeal in exchange for avoiding a possible death sentence.
A jury also found him guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
