Jeff Parness continues to "pay it forward" through his nonprofit, New York Says Thank You.
The volunteer group helps rebuild communities after a disaster.
It has also become custodians for the National 9/11 Flag, which was damaged at ground zero.
People in all 50 states are helping to stitch the flag back to its original 13-stripe format.
