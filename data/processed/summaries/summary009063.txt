Anti-government protests have swept Turkey for over a week.
The message to the government from demonstrators is simply: Don't control us.
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party labeled the protestors as "a few looters".
Rock star and environmentalist Haluk Levent, 44, says Erdogan needs to start listening.
