Britain stops a $33.6 million aid payment to Rwanda over claims that it backs M23 rebel group.
Rwanda's foreign minister says the British decision is based on false allegations.
The rebel group seized a city in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo last week.
More than 140,000 people have been forced from their homes by the fighting.
