VW CEO Martin Winterkorn tells CNN Mexico is key in carmaker's North American growth.
Volkswagen aims to become the biggest carmaker in the world by 2018.
Sales in the U.S. jumped 26% in 2012, helping to offset weaker European sales.
Winterkorn: In 2013 "we expect an overall market growth of 8% in China".
