John Terry's representatives order legal probe into alleged use of Chelsea star's image.
A blurred picture resembling Terry has appeared in an Indian anti-smoking campaign.
England captain's agency says that no permission was given to use the image.
Terry faces court proceedings in February after being charged of racially abusing an opponent.
