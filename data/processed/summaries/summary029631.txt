NEW: Facebook appears to have pulled the 'Find Friends Nearby' feature.
The feature uses phones' GPS to show which of your friends are near your location.
Blog ReadWriteWeb already has dubbed the feature a "stalking app".
It appears Facebook users must opt in to the feature, which may allay privacy concerns.
