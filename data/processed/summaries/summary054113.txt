NEW: The flight was supposed to take passengers to a lodge, the lodge's owner says.
The aircraft "struck the runway and burned" at a southern Alaska airport, FAA says.
By the time firefighters arrived, the aircraft was engulfed.
"There were 10 souls on the aircraft and all perished," an official says.
