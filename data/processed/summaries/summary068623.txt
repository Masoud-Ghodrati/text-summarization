The attorney general of West Virginia has taken on the case of two seventh-grade girls.
The girls allege they were sexually assaulted by two classmates during the school year.
The AG says local officials worked to protect the accused and punish their accusers.
The accused are relatives of school system employees, the attorney general says.
