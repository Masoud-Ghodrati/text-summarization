As Haiti recovers from January quake, children bear a heavy burden, says Samuel Dalembert.
He says it's important that kids not only survive, but are educated and kept healthy.
Dalembert recalls growing up poor in Haiti, sharing with friends who had less.
He and other kids vowed if they got any opportunity, they would use it to do great things, he says.
