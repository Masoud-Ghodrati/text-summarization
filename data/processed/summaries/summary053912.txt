Ouya is a $99 gaming console that will require all games be offered for free.
The console, which runs on Google's Android system, raised $8.6 million on Kickstarter.
Founder Julie Uhrman says she wants gaming on TV to be social, fun again.
Kickstarter backers get Ouyas late this month; it's on sale to everyone in June.
