Debra Milke was convicted of murder in her son's death and given the death penalty.
A judge tossed her conviction; the jury didn't know a detective's "history of misconduct".
Arizona's attorney general says he'll appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Milke sent "her young son off to be shot, executive style," the attorney general says.
