Richard Holbrooke first went to Bosnia in 1992 in the early days of the war.
The former diplomat recommended using U.S. force against the Bosnian Serbs.
He watched as Bosnia's Muslims suffered years of heartbreak and death.
In 1995, after weeks of NATO bombing, Holbrooke negotiated an end to the war.
