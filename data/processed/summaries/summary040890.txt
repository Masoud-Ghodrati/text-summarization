A South Korea court ruled that both Apple and Samsung violated each other's patents.
Samsung must pay $35,300 for infringing two Apple patents for iPhone and iPad.
Apple was found to have infringed Samsung's Wi-Fi technology, and must pay $22,000.
Case comes as a jury decides a similar patent case in the U.S. with much higher stakes.
