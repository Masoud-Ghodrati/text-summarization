Nafees Syed: Harvard is honoring Marty Peretz, who said "Muslim life is cheap".
She says she feels betrayed that alma mater would honor man who espouses such views.
As ex-Harvard prof and New Republic's editor, Peretz lends legitimacy to bigotry, she says.
To honor him, she says, lends credibility to all his derogatory remarks about many groups.
