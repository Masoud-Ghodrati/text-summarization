Ethiopian Zeray Alemseged discovered the fossil known as "the world's oldest child".
The skeletal remains belonged to a three-year-old girl who died 3.3 million years ago.
Alemseged, who made the discovery in Ethiopia in 2000, named the fossil Selam.
Today Alemseged is the director of anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences.
