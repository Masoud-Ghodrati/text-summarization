NEW: Police are looking for people who bought lots of bread rolls or mouse poison locally.
Police: The sandwiches were left in a box with a label saying they were a present to be eaten.
About 25 workers at a firm in Steinfeld ate the bread rolls but have shown no symptoms.
Tests on a substance noticed on top of the rolls revealed rat or mouse poison.
