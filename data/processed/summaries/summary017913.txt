NEW: Iran has rejected previous claims by Azerbaijan of involvement in plots on its soil.
The spy ring was supplied with military training and weapons, Azerbaijani officials say.
Its members were recruited by Iranian special agents, the national security ministry says.
The spy ring was allegedly plotting attacks on Israeli and Western targets in Azerbaijan.
