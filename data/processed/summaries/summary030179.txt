NEW: The United States expresses "concern" about the measures in the bill.
The State Duma approves a bill barring U.S. adoption, state media says.
The measure also imposes restrictions on NGOs and U.S. officials.
If approved by the Federation Council, the bill will go to Putin to be signed into law.
