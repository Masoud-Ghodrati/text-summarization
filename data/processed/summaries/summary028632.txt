Homeboy Industries started in 1988 to help ease tensions among gangs.
A new program funded by Homeboy trains ex-gang members on green jobs.
"It's a lesson in that you don't have to kill your neighbors," says Richard Reyes.
Ex-gang member says friends all went to jail: "I didn't want to live that life".
