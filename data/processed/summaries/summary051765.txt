Chavez returned Monday at 2:30 a.m. local time, vice president says.
Chavez hadn't appeared in public or on national television in more than two months.
In Chavez's absence, Venezuela sees a major economic change with currency devaluation.
Prison violence last month prompted criticism from human rights groups.
