NEW: Early storms this year don't portend a more active season, forecasters say.
Up to 15 named Atlantic storms are expected, including one to three major hurricanes.
A major hurricane packs winds well over 100 miles per hour.
Uncertainty over formation of an El Nino weather pattern affects the prediction.
