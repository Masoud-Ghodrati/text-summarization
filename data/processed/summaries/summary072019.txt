NEW: "Beasley is a master manipulator" who deserves death, a prosecutor says.
A jury had convicted Richard Beasley of aggravated murder, among other charges.
It urges death sentence; the judge says the jury will announce sentence Tuesday.
Beasley killed three men who answered a Craisglist ad to work on a cattle farm.
