The reunions will take place between February 20 and 25, South Korea says.
North Korea canceled previously scheduled reunions last year.
Seoul says it told Pyongyang that "what happened last year cannot be repeated".
North Korea has called for better sides, but tensions remain over U.S.-South Korean drills.
