Sherry Arnold, 43, went for a run on Saturday and hasn't been seen since.
Authorities found a lone shoe on her route but haven't disclosed anything else.
The FBI says it has scaled back its search, even as it pleads for more information.
Arnold's husband says he trusts the FBI, adding simply, "We want her back".
