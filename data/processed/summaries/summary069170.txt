NEW: Mubarak's lawyer has requested a German doctor be allowed to visit him.
Lawyer Farid El Deeb says Hosni Mubarak had major surgery in June 2010.
His trial on charges he ordered protesters shot is set to start August 3.
Doctors say he has a host of problems, but an expert says the trial should go on.
