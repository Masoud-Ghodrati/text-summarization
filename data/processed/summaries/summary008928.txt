Hillary Clinton and Leon Panetta sit for a joint interview at NATO in Brussels.
Panetta says a nuclear test by North Korea would be a provocation.
He refused to discuss what specific action the U.S. would take against North Korea.
Clinton says it was too early to know if Kim Jong Un will follow the lead of his late father.
