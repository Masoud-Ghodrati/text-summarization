Adkins joins a long list of musical acts who have canceled SeaWorld shows recently.
Rep: "Trace prefers that the focus of his performances be on music, not on controversy".
Trisha Yearwood, Willie Nelson and others canceled because of 'Blackfish' backlash.
Only Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery remain on SeaWorld's original schedule.
