NEW: The quake is a reminder "We live in earthquake country," scientist says.
"We expect thousands of events (like this) over several days," seismologist Lucy Jones says.
Sunday's shaking in California's Imperial Valley is the most activity since the 1970s.
No injuries and only minor damage have been reported.
