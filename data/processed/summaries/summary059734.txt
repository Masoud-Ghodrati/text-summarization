Police say Cynthia Osokogu was lured to Lagos using social networking sites under false pretenses.
Suspects targeted her as they believed she would be carrying large amounts of cash, police say.
In Lagos, she was taken to a hotel, drugged, and sexually assaulted, before being murdered, they say.
Nigerians are some of the most active social media users in Africa.
