City workers in Placentia found the backpack in a storm drain, a sheriff's spokesman says.
6 grenades, blasting caps and fuse igniters were in the backpack and nearby dirt.
The explosive devices likely had been there for some time, sheriff's spokesman adds.
They have been safely detonated, he says.
