Circles Robinson is an American who has lived in Havana since 2001.
"Havana is the only capital city I've seen that I would want to live in," he says.
He says the Malecon seawall is a great place to "think, relax and observe".
You can hear authentic Cuban music at "penas" -- intimate music sessions.
