ESA's next mission, BepiColombo, will explore the planet closest to the Sun, Mercury.
The probe will launch in 2016 and reach Mercury in 2024.
It will endure temperatures of 350 degrees Celsius and observe Mercury from orbit.
The data will be used, among other things, to confirm Einstein's theory of relativity.
