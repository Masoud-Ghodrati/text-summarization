Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush delivered the University of South Carolina's commencement speech on Monday.
The speech came as Bush considers a bid for the Republican 2016 presidential nomination.
Bush didn't address his political future during the speech, but encouraged students not to "be afraid to shake things up".
