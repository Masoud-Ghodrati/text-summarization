Jonathan Pollard is serving a life sentence after a 1987 spying conviction.
The former U.S. intelligence analyst was convicted of spying for Israel.
Sources say the U.S. and Israel are discussing his possible release.
If that happened, it would be part of efforts to save fragile Middle East peace negotiations.
