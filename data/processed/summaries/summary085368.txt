NEW: Paul Merhige waives the right to appeal as part of his plea agreement.
He gets seven life terms after pleading guilty to murders, but avoids the death penalty.
Authorities say he shot several relatives, some fatally, on Thanksgiving in 2009.
Some victims' family members rejected the plea deal, others supported it.
