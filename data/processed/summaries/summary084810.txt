President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney struggle in settings that are less predictable.
Obama will have to squelch professorial tone. Romney will have to show he can relate to voters.
Previous presidential candidates have also tripped up in town halls.
Obama can use likability, Romney can use dignity to gain edge.
