David Perry: It's hard to build inclusive world when people mock Down syndrome.
On Ira Glass show, comedian Wyatt Cenac made derisive reference to Down syndrome.
He says Glass said it's fair game for comedy. Perry, who has Down syndrome son, disagrees.
Perry: Cenac, Glass can defend comedy, but don't get to say whether hurt it causes is real.
