Leslie Sanchez says Maya Angelou, whose life has inspired many women, has turned 82.
She says Angelou tells women to "grab life by the lapels," but culture presents hurdles.
Women succeed in earning, education; lag in Congress, pop culture portrayals, she says.
Sanchez: Angelou can inspire women to be determined, resilient and to surmount barriers.
