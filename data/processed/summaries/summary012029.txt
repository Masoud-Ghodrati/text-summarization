A jury last August ordered Samsung to pay Apple pay more than $1 billion.
Jurors determined Samsung copied the iPhone's design and software.
A judge now says over $450 million of that is based on "impermissible legal theories".
She orders a new trial on key aspects of the case; $600 million of the award stands.
