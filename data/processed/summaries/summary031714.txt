The Lowndes County, Georgia, Sheriff's Office says it does not believe an anonymous e-mail.
The e-mail claimed that a former schoolmate confessed to killing Johnson, 17.
Johnson's body was found in a rolled-up mat in his high school gym more than a year ago.
The death was ruled an accident, but an independent pathologist called it a homicide.
