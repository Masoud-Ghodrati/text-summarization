Gregory Maguire: J.K. Rowling has moxie, derring-do to reunite with her readers as adults.
He says she doesn't need the money, she's written her new novel out of a need to write.
Toggling between adult and youth writing more common in UK, less so in U.S., he says.
Maguire: Writing for children is excellent way to start; they are a more demanding audience.
