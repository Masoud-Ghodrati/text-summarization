David Bianculli says Conan O'Brien protected himself by shunning NBC time shift.
He says bad NBC decisions, O'Brien's own poor ratings led him to fail at hosting gig.
Dropping Jay Leno's prime-time show was network's one smart call, he says.
Bianculli: O'Brien has forced NBC's hand: repeal offer or return Leno to "Tonight Show".
