Texas teen facing a terrorism charge over an alleged threat on Facebook is free on bail.
Justin Carter, 19, spent five months in prison for what he says was a sarcastic comment.
He was freed after an anonymous donor posted a $500,000 bond.
"I just think it got taken out of context, and it's been blown out of proportion," Carter says.
