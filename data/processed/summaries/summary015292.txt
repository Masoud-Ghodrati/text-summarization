"The Monuments Men" movie rekindles memories of a grandfather's Army service.
In 1946, Seymour Pomrenze oversaw a depot of cultural artifacts looted by Nazis.
Pomrenze's job was to get them back to the countries and institutions they belonged to.
The depot, under him and his successors, managed to return more than 3 million objects.
