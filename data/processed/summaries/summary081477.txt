Jamie Oliver: Child Nutrition Bill failed, which means same old unhealthy school lunches.
Schools serve junk food like chocolate milk, soda and pizza at each meal, he writes.
700 groups want this kind of law, he writes. Does Congress not value children's health?.
Parents should see what kids are eating, Oliver says, and if disgusted, push for healthy food.
