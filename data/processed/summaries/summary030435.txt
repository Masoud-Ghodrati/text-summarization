Masoud Fathi launched the Kurd Men for Equality Facebook campaign in Kurdish area of Iran.
The campaign was at once a pro-feminist and anti-Iranian regime statement.
The Kurdish community still has honor killings and genital mutilation according to experts.
Hollywood actress Rosario Dawson said to be a supporter of the campaign.
