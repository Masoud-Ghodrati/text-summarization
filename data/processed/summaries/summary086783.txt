An estimated 50,000 more patients are alive today that wouldn't be if hospitals kept making the same number of mistakes they did in 2010.
A 2010 federal investigation had found that 27% of Medicare patients had come to some kind of harm because of the care they received at the hospital.
The biggest improvement came in the form of prescription drug errors, those were down 40%.
