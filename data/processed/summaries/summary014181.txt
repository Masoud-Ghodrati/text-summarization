CNN journalist sees woman burst into hotel saying Gadhafi supporters raped, beat her.
Khalil Abdallah understood her cries in Arabic: "Look at what Gadhafi's brigades did to me!".
Abdallah says government minders violently blocked journalists, broke his camera.
Abdallah saw one minder with a gun in his hand, so the photojournalist backed away.
