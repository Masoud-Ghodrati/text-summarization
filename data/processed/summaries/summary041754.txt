Diango Cissoko is named as Mali's new interim prime minster.
Interim PM Cheick Modibo Diarra was arrested, then resigned on television Tuesday.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he's "troubled" by Diarra's resignation.
The international community is worried that a wing of al Qaeda is expanding into Mali.
