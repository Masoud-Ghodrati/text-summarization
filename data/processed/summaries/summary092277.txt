An Ebola outbreak in West Africa has infected more than 1,700 people.
CNN's Brent Swails and David McKenzie traveled to an Ebola treatment center in Sierra Leone.
MSF workers there say they need more experts in the community tracing the disease.
Their center is based in a district with a population of 500,000, and they have just 80 beds.
