Guard suffered cuts, was able to walk out of the prison after his rescue, official says.
"We are looking into security issues," a corrections spokesman says.
The incident started just before 5 p.m. ET Thursday at Lee Correctional Institute.
In June, a guard was held hostage for several hours at the same prison before being freed.
