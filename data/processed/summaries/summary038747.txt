Ruben Navarrette: 2016 GOP candidate should be young, to make Dem opponent look old.
He says we're 'allowed' to mention older male candidates' age but not Hillary's. It's an issue.
Candidates age quickly in tough office. With some exceptions, youth, vigor better, he says.
Navarrette: Candidates should be capped at 60. 2016 message: 'Go young, or go home'.
