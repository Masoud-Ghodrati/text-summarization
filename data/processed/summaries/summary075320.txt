President Barack Obama didn't mention or comparatively downplayed a number of key issues in his State of the Union.
He mostly avoided ObamaCare and immigration reform, despite acting on those issues during his time in office.
He also ignored gun control and campaign finance reform, two of progressives' pet priorities.
