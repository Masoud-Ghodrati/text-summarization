NEW: A court hearing on whether to bill Casey Anthony is rescheduled to September 2.
The sheriff's office spent $293,123 investigating Caylee Anthony's disappearance.
That figure counts only detective work; the cost of other deputies' work isn't included.
Prosecutors want Casey Anthony to pay the cost and those of other law agencies.
