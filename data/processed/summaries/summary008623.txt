Leaders of pro-Hillary Clinton groups are meeting in New York City on Friday.
The super PAC Ready for Hillary is hosting the all day strategy session.
The groups are coordinating ahead of the former secretary of state's likely run for president.
Some groups will wind down when Clinton announces and others will ramp up.
