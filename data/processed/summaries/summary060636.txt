Official: Khorasan plot involving concealed bombs on airplanes "was just one option".
The threat from the Khorasan Group was not imminent, a U.S. official says.
One feared operative is Muhsin al Fadhli, a Kuwaiti with a disturbing resume.
A source says al Fadhli and Khorasan are taking cues from the recruiting success of ISIS.
