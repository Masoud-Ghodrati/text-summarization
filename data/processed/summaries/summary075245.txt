Pam Fontaine and Tara Profitt are playing table tennis at the London Paralympics.
They first competed in the Games in 1984 and are delighted to make Team USA again.
Both embraced wheelchair sport after they were paralyzed as teenagers in accidents.
They lost touch for more than two decades before being reunited through table tennis.
