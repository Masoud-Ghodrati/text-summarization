Niklas Edin took up curling after watching Sweden take bronze at the 1998 Olympics.
Edin won a world junior title before claiming a European and world championship double.
He has worked on his temper and has had to overcome a back injury that required surgery.
Edin and teammates will be among the favorites at the Olympics in Sochi in February.
