Yale graduate student Annie Le's body was found inside a wall at a Yale lab building.
Former lab technician Raymond Clark III pleaded guilty to murder and attempted sexual assault.
The suit claims Yale created a culture of tolerance that allowed aggressive male behavior.
Yale says the suit has "no basis" and had no information Clark could commit such a crime.
