State investigators have taken control of a drug testing lab in Delaware.
They are trying to find out if evidence has been tampered with, substituted or removed.
A sealed envelope opened in court during a drug trial contained a surprise switch.
The state wants pending trials involving the lab be stayed for 60 days.
