John Avlon: Ken Cuccinelli appears too extreme for swing voters in Virginia.
Democrat Terry McAuliffe would be vulnerable against almost any other Republican, he says.
Avlon: Cuccinelli's candidacy symbolizes trouble GOP faces in 2014, 2016 elections.
The run to the right shows what not to do nationally and in Virginia, he says.
