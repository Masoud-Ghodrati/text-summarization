Wendy Weiser: Supreme Court's Arizona ruling points up need for voting modernization in U.S..
Court said Congress, not states, regulates vote. Motor voter act aimed to make it easier, she says.
She says registration must move to digital age, replacing paper system, admitting more voters.
Weiser: Some states already do this. We need national voting standard for election process.
