The suspect admitted to victimizing at least 100 people, mostly teens, FBI says.
Richard Finkbiner, 39, allegedly threatened to post teens' videos on gay porn sites.
"You want to play this game or you want to be a gay porn star?" he allegedly told teens.
It could take months to identify the victims, a prosecutor's spokesman says.
