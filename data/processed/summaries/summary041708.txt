Ilham Tohtia, a prominent Uyghur scholar, was charged with "separatism".
Detained by police in January, he was taken to his native province of Xinjiang.
Police say they gathered firm evidence of him colluding with overseas forces to "spread separatist ideas".
Tohti's lawyers have said that the scholar continues to emphasize his innocence.
