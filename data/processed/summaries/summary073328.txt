Seoul says it believes North Korea fired three short-range missiles earlier this week.
Short-range missile tests are common and cause less concern than longer-range ones.
The tests come nearly a month after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
His youngest son and designated successor, Kim Jong Un, has become the new leader.
