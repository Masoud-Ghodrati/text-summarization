In Baghdad, the Badr Brigade, a Shiite militia, offers women a 5-day weapons training course.
The training aims to make them "ready if (ISIS) makes it into their neighborhood," major says.
More than 450 women have been through the training since the group started it this year.
The members of one class range between the ages of 14 and 60.
