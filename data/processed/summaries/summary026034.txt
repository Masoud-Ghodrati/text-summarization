NEW: John Demjanjuk was living in a home for the elderly pending appeal of his conviction.
Demjanjuk, a onetime U.S. auto worker, was convicted in Germany last year.
He was found guilty of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp.
Prosecutors said he was an accessory to nearly 28,000 deaths.
