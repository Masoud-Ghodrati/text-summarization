Williams founder Frank Williams will step down from the team's board next month.
Williams founded the British team in 1977 and the marque has won nine constructors' titles.
His daughter Claire will move onto the board as director of marketing and communications.
Williams have not won a grand prix since Juan Pablo Montayo's victory in Brazil in 2004.
