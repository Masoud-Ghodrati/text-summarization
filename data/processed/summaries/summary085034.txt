Keith Jones' son Gordon died on BP oil rig leaving behind wife, two sons.
Jones trying to change law that deprives Gordon's family of fair compensation, he says.
Law passed in 1920 only pays for lost wages if death caused from malfeasance.
Jones: Law must change, despite big oil, shipping and cruise lines' opposition.
