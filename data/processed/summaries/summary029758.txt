CDC: 99,000 people die annually from hospital-acquired infections.
Don't forget the basics: Make people wash their hands before touching you.
Staying warm before, during surgery can help fight infection; ask for extra blankets.
Before surgery, if shaving is required, request clippers, not a razor, which can nick.
