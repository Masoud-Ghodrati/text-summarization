Josef Wegner of University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology made discovery.
Pictures in tombs of Abydos in Egyptian desert date from around 1600 B.C..
Wegner found the name of an unknown pharaoh of the shadowy Abydos Dynasty.
Tomb is "the necropolis of an entire forgotten dynasty," Wegner says in statement.
