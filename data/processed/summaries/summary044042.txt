Mount Airy may have inspired Mayberry, a fictional town where "The Andy Griffith Show" was set.
The North Carolina town is the birthplace of Andy Griffith, who died Tuesday.
Mount Airy -- with a population of about 10,000 -- is also home to the Andy Griffith Museum.
The building is filled with memorabilia collected by the actor's friend, Emmett Forrest.
