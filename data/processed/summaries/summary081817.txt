Mark David Chapman wrote letters to the New York City police officer who arrested him.
He repeatedly tells the officer to read the book, "The Catcher in the Rye".
Chapman says others "could -- and would -- have served the same purpose" as John Lennon.
He killed Lennon in 1980 and is serving a sentence of 20 years to life in prison.
