NEW: Seoul says the North's demands are "preposterous".
The North lists "practical measures" it says the U.S. and South Korea should take.
It wants U.N. sanctions to be lifted and no more U.S.-South Korean military drills.
The U.S. has said talks can only happen if the North moves away from its nuclear program.
