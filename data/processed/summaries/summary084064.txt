The deal helps clear the way for Honduras to rejoin the Organization of American States.
It was brokered by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments and signed in Colombia.
The accord also allows allies of ousted ex-President Manuel Zelaya to return to Honduras.
Zelaya was deposed in a coup nearly two years ago.
