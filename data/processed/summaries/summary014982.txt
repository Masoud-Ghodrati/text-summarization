Six non-European cardinals are appointed in a ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica.
American Archbishop James M. Harvey is among those elevated.
The cardinals' main role is to advise the pope and pick his successor.
"A variety of faces" in the College of Cardinals represents an inclusive church, pope says.
