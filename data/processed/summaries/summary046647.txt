Four workers on the ground were killed in the crash.
The pilot probably saved lives by guiding the plane to a less crowded area, an official says.
The plane hit buildings under construction in an area housing Pakistani naval officers.
All 8 killed onboard were Russian crew members of the Sudan-bound aircraft.
