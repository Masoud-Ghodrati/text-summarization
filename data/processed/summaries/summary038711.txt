NEW: David Kwiatkowski also worked at Johns Hopkins in Maryland and in five other states.
Kwiatkowski, 32, is accused of infecting at least 30 people.
The evidence "points irrefutably to Kwiatkowski," a U.S. attorney says.
Co-workers witnessed suspicious behavior and symptoms, according to an affidavit.
