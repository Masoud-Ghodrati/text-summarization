NEW: Manson is being held in isolation after being caught with a weapon in October.
"We will never hear from Charlie Manson again," says Debra Tate, sister of victim.
"I have put five people in the grave. ... I'm a very dangerous man," Manson told psychologist.
Manson, 77, serving a life sentence for nine murders, didn't show up to hearing.
