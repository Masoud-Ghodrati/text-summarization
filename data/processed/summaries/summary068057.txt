The Galapagos Islands are home to species of animals found nowhere else on Earth.
With few predators to make them wary, the creatures seem tame and curious.
Galapagos tourism has been booming despite the archipelago's remote location.
Lodgings are available on four of the islands; many visitors also stay on cruise ships.
