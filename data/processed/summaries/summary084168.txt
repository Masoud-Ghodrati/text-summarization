NEW: Rules address "continued" robocalls, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski says.
NEW: Robocalls include an automated, interactive opt-out feature, he says.
Also limited are "dead air" calls in which no one is on the line when the call is answered.
Rules do not apply to companies that have a real person dialing the number.
