Brandon Holt, 6, was shot in the head by a 4-year-old playmate on Monday.
He was pronounced dead at a New Jersey hospital the next day.
His father tells the Asbury Park Press that the family chose to donate the boy's organs.
"We (hope) it would help carry his name, that he's helping somebody," he says.
