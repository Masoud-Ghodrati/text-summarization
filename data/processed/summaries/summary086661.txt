9/11 led U.S. to strike back at al Qaeda and take smart measures, says Fareed Zakaria.
He says in the years after attacks, U.S. has overestimated threat from al Qaeda.
He says group is on the run and widely discredited in the Muslim world.
Zakaria: U.S. needs to scale its security policies and bureaucracy to the actual threat.
