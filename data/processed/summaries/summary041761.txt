A woman of dual Spanish-German citizenship accuses Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal of rape.
After a lengthy process, a Spanish court dismisses the case for lack of evidence.
The ruling confirms the prince's long-standing account of innocence, his legal team says.
But the prince endures "a grave injustice" from the "false and baseless" charge, the team says.
