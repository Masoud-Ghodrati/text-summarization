Kassim Al-Himidi is in custody on suspicion of murdering his Iraqi wife.
Shaima Alawadi, 32, died in March after she was attacked at her home.
A note beside the body called the family "terrorists," her daughter said.
Police say now Alawadi's death was the result of domestic violence, not a hate crime.
