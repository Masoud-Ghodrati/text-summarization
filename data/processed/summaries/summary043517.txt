Since 2011, more than 1 million Syrian children have become refugees, the UNHCR says.
As many as 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict, leaving many children orphaned.
CNN's reporters have been filing harrowing reports on the impact of the war on Syria's children.
Video reports show them under fire in Syria, struggling to cope in refugee camps outside.
