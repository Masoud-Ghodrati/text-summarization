Rory McIlroy spurned a four-shot lead on the final day of the 2011 Masters.
Two months later the Northern Irishman triumphed at the U.S. Open, his first major crown.
He became the youngest world No. 1 since Tiger Woods in 2000 earlier this month.
His fellow Briton Luke Donald has since reclaimed top spot in the world rankings.
