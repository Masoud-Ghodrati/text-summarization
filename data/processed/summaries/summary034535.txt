A controversial gun measure in Missouri failed to override veto by one vote.
John Donohue: The measure's claim that a state can nullify federal law is absurd.
He says in states like Colorado and Iowa, gun rights advocates are gaining ground.
Donohue: Gun owners must be more responsible to not be duped by NRA deceptions.
