South Africa's fifth democratic elections are held this Wednesday - first since Nelson Mandela's death.
President Jacob Zuma is most divisive figure in South African politics today, says Justice Malala.
Malala: Several scandals have wracked his administration since he came to power in 2009.
He predicts Zuma will win power, but ANC will lose share of the vote.
