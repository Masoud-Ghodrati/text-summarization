Switzerland wins its first Davis Cup title after Roger Federer routs Richard Gasquet.
The Swiss win the series 3-1 in Lille to disappoint most of the large crowd in northern France.
Federer has won almost everything in his career, just missing an Olympic singles gold.
He got support from Stan Wawrinka, who shone in his two matches this weekend.
