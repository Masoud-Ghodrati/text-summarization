Three lawsuits to declare four chimpanzees "legal persons" rejected by courts.
The Nonhuman Rights Project says Tommy, Kiko, Hercules and Leo deserve "bodily liberty".
Tommy's owner says the chimp is not held in a prison, calls lawsuit "ridiculous".
Rights group says it will appeal, file suits for other "self-aware" animals.
