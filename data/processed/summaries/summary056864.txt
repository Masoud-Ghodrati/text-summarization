Indirect talks between Israelis and Palestinians resume, Egyptian news service says.
The talks are taking place amid a three-day cease-fire brokered by Egypt.
Humanitarian needs in Gaza are "very, very big right now," Red Cross official says.
Hamas warns it won't stay long "in the absence of serious negotiations".
