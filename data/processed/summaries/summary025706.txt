Abdul Hakeem Belhaj is one of Libya's top anti-Gadhafi rebel commanders.
Some western analysts are concerned with his prominent role, given his past association with Islamist forces.
Belhaj was part of a group of Libyans that fought alongside al Qaeda against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
Belhaj says the fact that he fought alongside al Qaeda doesn't mean he agrees with the aims of the organization.
