More than 2,100 volunteers around the world have signed on to the World Memory Project.
Project is world's largest online searchable database of records related to Holocaust victims.
Volunteers have added more than 765,000 records to the database in six months.
Nazis gave them numbers, and project gives them back their names, director says.
