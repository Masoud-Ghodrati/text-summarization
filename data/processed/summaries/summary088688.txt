Uruguay forward Luis Suarez is unveiled in front of Barcelona's fans on Monday.
He was allowed to take part in the unveiling after a CAS verdict last week.
Fans chanted, "Suarez, Suarez, Suarez" not long after he entered pitch.
Suarez received a ban from FIFA after biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup.
