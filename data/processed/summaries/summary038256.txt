African Union - United Nations peacekeepers are attacked in a Darfur refugee camp.
A peacekeeper from Bangladesh dies and another peacekeeper is wounded, UNAMID says.
A UNAMID official calls the attack "cowardly deplorable" and a war crime.
Widespread violence has plagued the Darfur region, in southern Sudan, since 2003.
