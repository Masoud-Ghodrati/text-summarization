Colombian police say they've detained four suspects tied to DEA agent's killing.
Washington has submitted an extradition request for the suspects, police say.
Two more suspects are at large, a CNN affiliate reports.
The agent was killed in a robbery attempt; officials do not believe it was tied to his work.
