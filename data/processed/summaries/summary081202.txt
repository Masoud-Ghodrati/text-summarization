Easton Neston is a playground for England's eccentric and carefree landed gentry.
The owner of this estate is no ordinary Lord of the Manor -- it's Russian tycoon Leon Max.
Max, who has launched his new clothing line in the UK, is enamored with all things English.
He also hosts huge dinner parties and shooting days at his country estate.
