New movie "The Lone Ranger" will come out this summer, styled after the old TV show.
Bob Greene: The Lone Ranger saved the day and left, not bragging or expecting accolades.
Greene: The message: Deeds stand for themselves. Don't blow your own horn.
Unlike today, Green says, he would never have tweeted out his fight against justice.
