Benjamin Todd Jealous says Van Jones, Obama's former green jobs "czar," is visionary.
He says Jones was misunderstood, unfairly discredited for early missteps.
Instead, he deserves praise for creating a model for a green jobs economy, he says.
Jealous: Jones' vision earned him the NAACP President's Award for 2010.
