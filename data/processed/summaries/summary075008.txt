Novak Djokovic wins a third straight World Tour Finals after Roger Federer withdraws.
Federer said he wasn't "match fit" and it would be "too risky" to play Sunday in London.
Federer had played for about three hours Saturday in beating fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka.
Federer will be needed if Switzerland is to down France in this week's Davis Cup final.
