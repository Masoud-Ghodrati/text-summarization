A wildfire burns 24 structures, including 10 homes, in Marion County, authorities say.
Images show some buildings reduced to rubble, beyond their frames or concrete walls.
The blaze prompted the partial closure of State Route 19 in central Florida.
The fire was 80% contained early Sunday evening, a forest service spokeswoman says.
