Mega Millions tickets worth $651,915,940 were sold Friday, a lottery spokeswoman says.
That's more than 1/3 the $1,491,082,270 in sales since the previous winner.
The three big winners bought their tickets in Kansas, Maryland and Illinois.
That assures them an equal share of the $656 million jackpot.
