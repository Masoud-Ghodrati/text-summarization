Don Blankenship faces four federal charges, including conspiracy and making false statements.
He oversaw the West Virginia mine that exploded in 2010, killing 29 workers.
Blankenship's attorney says he will fight the charges, and be acquitted.
The Upper Big Branch explosion was one of the worst U.S. mine disasters in decades.
