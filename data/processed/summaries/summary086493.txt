Mahdi Hashi's family wants to know how he came to be charged in a U.S. court.
Hashi came to Britain as a six-year-old, fleeing Somalia's civil war.
His family claims he was pressured by Britain's MI5 secret service to become a spy.
He vanished from Somalia in 2011 and reappeared in Brooklyn, charged with terror offenses.
