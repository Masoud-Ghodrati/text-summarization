A group headed by former FBI Director Louis Freeh has been poring over Penn State e-mails.
E-mails provided to CNN show that Joe Paterno wielded power beyond the realm of football.
An official says in a 2005 e-mail that Paterno wanted to keep disciplinary matters internal.
"Coach Paterno would rather we NOT inform the public ... despite any moral or legal obligation ...".
