Bob Greene saw a billboard saying "The First Person To Live To 150 Is Alive Today".
Greene: We live longer than ever due to medical advances, good nutrition, keeping fit.
Greene: Still, a person who was 150 today would have been born during Civil War.
He asks: But who wants to be 75 and be aware that you've got another 75 years to go?.
