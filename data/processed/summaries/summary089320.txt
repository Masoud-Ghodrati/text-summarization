Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, says the U.S. should do more to oust Moammar Gadhafi.
McCain is a senior congressional authority of military and foreign affairs.
McCain made a surprise visit to the Libyan rebel stronghold of Benghazi on Friday.
A foreign policy analyst says the visit will increase pressure on the Obama administration.
