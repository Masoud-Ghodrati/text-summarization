NEW: U.S. official: Iraqi forces targeted ISIS leader in airstrike.
Iraq's defense minister and the Interior Ministry say Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was injured.
The Iraqi prime minister's office can't confirm, and analysts are skeptical about the claims.
U.S says coalition airstrikes targeted a convoy in Mosul, but it's not clear if al-Baghdadi was hit.
