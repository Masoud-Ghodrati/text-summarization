This weekend, Ukrainians mark the end of 40 days mourning for those killed in Maidan square.
At least 100 people died when anti-government protesters clashed with riot police.
Michael Bociurkiw says the protest movement will stay in Maidan beyond elections in May.
But he says organizers have prevented any violence in case it factors into Putin's plans.
