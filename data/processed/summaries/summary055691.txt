NEW: A spokeswoman for Alabama's governor stands behind the legislation.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, ACLU and other join in filing a lawsuit in federal court.
The lawsuit claims that an anti-illegal immigrant law passed in Alabama is unconstitutional.
An SPLC official calls the bill even more "radical" than similar ones in Arizona and Georgia.
