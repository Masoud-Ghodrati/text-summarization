NEW: Migrant workers are often duped into taking jobs, the report's author says.
As many as 600,000 people may be victims of forced labor in the Middle East, ILO says.
Migrant workers give accounts of being raped, abused or kept prisoner by employers.
Employers or agents sometimes withhold wages or documents to prevent workers leaving.
