Welch's death is "devastating" and "so,so sad," Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks says.
Welch's wife found his body in their Nashville home Thursday afternoon, police say.
"All indications are that it was a suicide," a police spokesman says.
Welch played guitar with Fleetwood Mac from 1971 until late 1974.
