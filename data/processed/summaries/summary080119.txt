An analysis of satellite images shows increased activity at North Korea's nuclear site.
South Korea says the images suggest the North is ready to conduct the test at any time.
North Korea is "awaiting a political decision" on the test, Seoul says.
The U.S. has warned Pyongyang that such a test would be "a serious miscalculation".
