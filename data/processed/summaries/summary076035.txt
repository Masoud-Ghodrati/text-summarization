Bob Greene says it's been awhile since baseball has been the U.S. national pastime.
He says life fragmented today; few things unify Americans as a shared pastime. TV once did.
He says Internet has further splintered interests; is computer screen new opiate of masses?.
Greene: New national pastime may just be multitasking. Makes you wish for baseball.
