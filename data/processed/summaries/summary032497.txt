Army veteran Roy Foster struggled with addiction and homelessness.
He could find no safe haven and decided to turn his life around and help other homeless vets.
A quarter of homeless adults are vets, and need mental, physical, re-entry help, he says.
Foster co-founded center to provide shelter and services for homeless vets and families.
