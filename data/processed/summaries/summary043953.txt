Mathieu Bastareaud scores two tries on return from international rugby wilderness.
France defeat Scotland 18-9 in their opening Six Nations match in Edinburgh.
It was center Bastareaud's first start since admitting he had lied about an assault in New Zealand.
The 21-year-old was banned three months after finally admitting he fell over while drunk.
