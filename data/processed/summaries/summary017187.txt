The Naval Criminal Investigative Service opened an investigation into missing cash.
$30,000 disappeared after rescue of captain of Maersk Alabama by Navy SEALs.
SEALs shot and killed three pirates, ending multi-day siege, freeing captain in April.
Pirates reportedly led captain at gun point to the ship's safe.
