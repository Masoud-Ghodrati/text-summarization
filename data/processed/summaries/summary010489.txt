Senegalese film "La Pirogue" is the only film from sub-Saharan Africa selected for Cannes.
It tells the story of a boatload of African migrants seeking to reach Spain's Canary Islands.
Director Moussa Toure said making the movie was deeply affecting.
African films, particularly from Senegal and Burkina Faso, have previously done well at Cannes.
