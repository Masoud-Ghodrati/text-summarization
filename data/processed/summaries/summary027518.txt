NEW: Arkansas' AG backs the prosecutor, says he still believes the men are guilty.
The men, who say they are innocent, can now work to free their names, one says.
The "West Memphis 3" go free after entering new pleas in a 1993 murder case.
They were convicted of killing three West Memphis second-graders in 1993.
