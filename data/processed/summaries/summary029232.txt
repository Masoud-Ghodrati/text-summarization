NEW: CDC official: Those being monitored for Ebola may be put on "no-board" list.
Vinson flew commercially in the time she was supposed to be self-monitoring for Ebola.
Dallas health care worker called CDC about temperature, wasn't told not to fly, official says.
CDC chief says that Vinson shouldn't have flown commercially, used "public transport".
