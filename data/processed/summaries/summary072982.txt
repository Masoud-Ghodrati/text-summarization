NEW: Marte Dalelv says it is a "fantastic feeling" to have her freedom back.
Dalelv says she has her passport now and wants to go home as soon as possible.
Norway: Dialogue, along with international pressure and interest, led to Dalelv's release.
Lawyer: A royal pardon wipes the slate clean; Dalelv's alleged attacker also is free.
