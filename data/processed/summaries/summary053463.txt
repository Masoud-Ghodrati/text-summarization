Bob Greene: On Super Bowl Sunday, football players will be called gutsy, heroic.
He says for real heroism, look to four WWII chaplains who sacrificed lives on this day in 1943.
He says the helped young soldiers to safety, giving up life vests, when their ship hit.
Greene: They went down with ship. Think of them while you're cheering football "heroes".
