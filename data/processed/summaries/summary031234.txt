NSA document leaker Edward Snowden says he was trained as a spy.
He worked for the CIA, NSA and Defense Intelligence Agency, he tells NBC's Brian Williams.
Calling him a contractor is bid "to distract from the totality of my experience," he says.
Snowden is in Russia to avoid prosecution in U.S. on espionage charges.
