Andy McNab argues being a psychopath is good for business, and that leaders should not have empathy.
The former SAS soldier and author is a psychopath and says he always knew he was different.
He tells Nina dos Santos he did not feel remorse when he killed during his time in the military.
But McNab says being a psychopath can be a matter of striking a balance.
