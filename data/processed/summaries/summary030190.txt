Indiana's attorney general has declared most of the state's new immigration law indefensible.
He cited the June Supreme Court ruling on Arizona in his announcement, says Ali Noorani.
Indiana is not alone in thinking there is a better way to enforce immigration law, Noorani says.
Noorani: It's time for the federal government to create a rational immigration process.
