A University of Calgary paleontologist shows off a Pachyrhinosaurus skull.
It's one of the biggest, if not the biggest, of its kind at 2 to 2.5 meters, she says.
The discovery is also remarkably intact, though there's still more to reveal.
Pachyrhinosaurs lived about 70 million years ago in Calgary's Alberta and Alaska.
