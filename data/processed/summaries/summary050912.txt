The annual Consumer Electronics Show kicks off Monday.
Televisions will be huge, and companies will experiment with new ways to deliver content.
Mobile devices will be generic, with a few 5-inch smartphones and cheap Android tablets.
With large companies lying low at CES, smaller players have a chance to stand out.
