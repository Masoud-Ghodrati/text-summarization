Youths yelled "kill the Jews," and threatened to cut throats of children, students say.
The school bus was carrying children aged 5 to 12 home from Jewish schools.
Terrified students on the bus called their parents, parents called police.
The youths fled before police arrived, but five arrests were made Thursday.
