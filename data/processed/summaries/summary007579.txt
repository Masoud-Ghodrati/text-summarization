Blind gamer is able to 'hang with friends' via social gaming.
Debbie Fisher, 37, has been legally blind for most of her life.
Using the Voice Over program, she's able to play "Hanging With Friends," a hangman-like game.
Some games work with voice commands, but Fisher says this one lets her communicate, too.
