Princess Madeleine and Christopher O'Neill met through mutual friends in New York.
"I immediately felt something special with Madeleine," says O'Neill.
Madeleine is the third child of Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia.
The wedding is planned for next summer but no date has yet been announced.
