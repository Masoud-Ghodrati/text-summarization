Singapore police investigate engineer Shane Todd's death as a suicide hanging.
But an independent forensic pathologist concludes homicide.
Todd's hard drive shows he worked on a project that may have led to his death, family says.
FBI will comply with Singapore police's request for help on U.S. soil, embassy says.
