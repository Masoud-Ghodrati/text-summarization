Kazuhiro Shirato went to his hometown of Tomioka, Japan, which has been evacuated.
The town is about 8 kilometers from the nuclear plant that's been in crisis since March 11.
He says he found the town was totally abandoned, except for dogs and some cows.
Angry at the plant's owner, Shirato says, "I doubt I will ever be able to go back".
