Howard Kurtz: Rupert Murdoch tweeted asking why Jewish owned press is anti-Israel.
He says suggesting Jews have hidden agenda, where religion trumps journalism, is offensive.
Kurtz: It's hypocritical from man who controls Fox News, WSJ, NY Post, other news organs.
Kurtz: "Apology' tweet cryptic; Murdoch's slam of reporters' 'biased' coverage gives no proof.
