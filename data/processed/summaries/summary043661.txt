Obese New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie underwent lap band stomach surgery to slim down.
Christie says he did it for wife and kids, but some think it's for a 2016 presidential run.
Bryan Monroe had gastric bypass surgery, warns Christie there will be criticisms.
But Monroe says like himself, Christie did it to live a healthy, long life.
