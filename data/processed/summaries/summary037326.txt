Rutgers coach Mike Rice fired after video shows him kicking and bullying players.
John Amaechi says this behavior is not rare, it is part of a damaging coaching culture.
We would never let French or math teachers abuse vulnerable kids this way, he says.
Amaechi: Abusive coaching is perpetuated from generation to generation and needs to stop.
