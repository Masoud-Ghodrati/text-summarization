Lt. Kellene Davis files her retirement papers, a Washington city official says.
She was in charge of a D.C. fire station whose crew didn't help a dying man Saturday.
The man's family says people were told to call 911 before the firefighters would help.
Washington's mayor has said he is "absolutely furious" about what happened.
