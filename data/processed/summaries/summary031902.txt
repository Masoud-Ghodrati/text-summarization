Jesper Parnevik said he had "lost all respect" for fellow golfer Tiger Woods following revelations about his private life.
Former European Ryder Cup star Parnevik and his wife introduced fellow Swede Elin Nordegren to her future husband.
Woods had previously apologized on his official Web site for "transgressions" and "personal sins and failings".
