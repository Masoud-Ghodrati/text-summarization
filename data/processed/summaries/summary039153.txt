Cyprus is trying to reach an agreement with the EU for a 10 billion euro bailout.
A proposal for a one-off levy on bank deposits resulted in a run on ATM machines.
Cyprus' tourist body says its ATMs are working normally and its business as usual.
Nonetheless, visitors are being advised to travel with more cash than normal.
