Crystal Mangum faces a murder and two larceny charges, the district attorney's office says.
Police say Mangum, 32, stabbed her boyfriend at their shared apartment earlier this month.
The man, 46, died from his injuries last Wednesday at a Durham, North Carolina, hospital.
3 Duke athletes were charged -- then cleared -- after Mangum accused them of sexual assault.
