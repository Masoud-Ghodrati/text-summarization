S.E. Cupp has gotten to know the family featured in A&E's "Duck Dynasty" series.
She says they are a Christian family that celebrates their religion and Scripture.
She disagrees with Phil Robertson's views on gays but says they're not a surprise.
Cupp says A&E's suspension of Robertson from show is an ungracious act.
