Martin was in the U.S. 101st Airborne Division, and parachuted into Normandy.
He parachutes from a plane again into the same area again, at the age of 93.
It didn't compare to his D-Day jump "because there wasn't anybody shooting".
Martin wants to show "you don't have to sit and die just because you get old".
