Two girls are left with severe burns to their faces after an acid attack on a college van.
The Pakistani Taliban say any girl seeking an education will be targeted in the same way.
A boy is also shot in the attack by "extremists," a local official says.
Acid attacks have been used in Pakistan to punish women for alleged dishonor.
