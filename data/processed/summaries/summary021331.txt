Italian Finance Minister Fabrizio Saccomanni told CNN that Italy "firmly" condemns the use of chemical weapons.
Saccomanni's comments come as members of U.S. Congress are due to debate support for military action.
U.S. President Barack Obama says he has "high confidence" that the regime is to blame for the use of chemical weapons.
Saccomanni also said he hoped the fragile coalition government did not fall.
