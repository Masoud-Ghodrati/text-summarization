New Black Panther Party offers $10,000 for "citizen's arrest" of George Zimmerman.
Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, 17, last month; he has not been charged with a crime.
A party official says "we are military" and doesn't trust the U.S. government.
The Southern Poverty Law Center describes the party as "virulently racist".
