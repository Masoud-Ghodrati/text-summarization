Arizona's Sheriff Joe Arpaio is sued by the Justice Department for Latino discrimination.
It's the first suit in the department's 18-year history in civil police reform work.
"It's hard to say" if Arpaio's career is on the line, a Republican spokesman remarks.
Latinos in Arizona are a growing political force.
