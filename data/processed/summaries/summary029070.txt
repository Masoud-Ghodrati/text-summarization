Somalia's prime minister orders an investigation into the alleged rape of a Somali woman.
She was allegedly attacked by AMISOM soldiers at a military base in Mogadishu.
"The Somali government will not tolerate violation of human rights," prime minister says.
AMISOM says it is investigating and appropriate action will be taken.
