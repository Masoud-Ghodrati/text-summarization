Aazis Richardson, 16, allegedly shot driver Vincent Darbenzio, 47, prosecutor says.
Teen thought driver was taking a longer route to increase the fare, prosecutor says.
"I just told him take this way; he didn't want to listen," teen told CNN affiliate WNEP.
The public defender's office, who is representing Richardson, could not be reached.
