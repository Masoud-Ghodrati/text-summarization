Typhoon Hagupit's wind strength is equivalent to that of a strong Category 5 hurricane.
It could hit the area around Tacloban devastated last year by Typhoon Haiyan.
"I'm more than nervous," says one survivor of Haiyan whose family home was destroyed.
Tens of thousands of people are still living in coastal areas considered to be danger zones.
