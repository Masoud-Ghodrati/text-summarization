Reihan Salam: Gov. Bob McDonnell isn't a leading GOP presidential contender.
Salam: McDonnell's 2009 campaign is a great template for a national GOP campaign.
He says the governor, popular and pragmatic, pushed for an important transportation bill.
Salam: It may be a long shot, but McDonnell should be included in GOP presidential field.
