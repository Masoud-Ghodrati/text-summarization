A prosecutor calls for Amanda Knox to be given a 30-year sentence at her retrial.
Knox and her former boyfriend are accused in the 2007 killing of a British student.
Their convictions were overturned in 2011, but a higher court last year ordered a retrial.
The prosecutor also calls for a 26-year sentence for Knox's ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito.
