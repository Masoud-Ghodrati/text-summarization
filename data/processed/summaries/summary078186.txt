A Chicago alderman says Chick-fil-A's president contradicts what executives told him.
The alderman says the execs assured him donations to anti-gay groups will stop.
Company President Dan Cathy said Friday there is no change in practices.
Cathy's comments on marriage stirred controversy earlier this year.
