Pilot of MH 370 was a supporter of Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim.
Anwar was sentenced to 5 years in jail hours before the plane vanished.
Some have speculated the plane could have been hijacked in response to the sentence.
Anwar says theory is meant to deflect from "incompetent" handling of crisis.
