Human Rights Watch describes latest ruling as a "disgrace to Pakistan's judiciary".
In 2010, a Pakistani court sentenced Christian woman Asia Bibi to death for blasphemy.
On October 16, the Lahore High Court upheld the verdict after hearing her appeal.
Bibi's attorney says he plans to appeal to Pakistan's Supreme Court, the highest court.
