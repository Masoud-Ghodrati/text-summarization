Apple's iPad Mini went on sale in 34 markets worldwide on Friday.
Demand appeared to be down compared to the throngs that met previous releases.
Device enters small-tablet territory already occupied by Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon's Kindle Fire.
Apple wouldn't comment on how many iPad Minis were pre-ordered.
