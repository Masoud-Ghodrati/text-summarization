Volunteers hit streets to offer H1N1 vaccine to homeless in Broward County, Florida.
They travel with a police escort to help with any situation they're not ready to handle.
Lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for homeless to catch the virus..
"A true blessing," says one of the men who received the shot.
