Tim Stanley: At trial, Breivik seems mad, but views on Islam mirror some from politicians.
Stanley: Breivik says Islam inferior to Christianity and elite liberals push multiculturalism.
Both false, he says, with Islam varied, rich; multiculturalism result of free-market economics.
Stanley: Breivik's views seem a tragic symptom of Western psychological angst about Islam.
