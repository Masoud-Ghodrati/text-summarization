In 2004, Chechen rebels took 1,200 people hostage at a school in Beslan, Russia.
Hundreds of people were killed during the subsequent three-day siege and military operation.
CNN's Nick Paton Walsh covered the hostage crisis for The Guardian newspaper.
Ten years on, he returns and finds victims of the siege still have unanswered questions.
