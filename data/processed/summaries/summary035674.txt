The Afghan spy agency finds no evidence against 72 inmates of Bagram prison.
A judiciary meeting chaired by President Hamid Karzai clears them for release.
The prisoners are "dangerous criminals" linked to terrorism, the United States says.
The release order comes amid broader tensions between Washington and Kabul.
