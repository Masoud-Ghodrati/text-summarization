Kim Dotcom's political party has formed an alliance with a Maori nationalist's party.
The alliance is seen in New Zealand as an unlikely political marriage of convenience.
The move will give both parties a better chance of winning seats in elections in September.
The U.S. is seeking to extradite German-born Dotcom on criminal digital piracy charges.
