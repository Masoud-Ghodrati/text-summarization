100 people are reported dead around Syria on Monday, an opposition group says.
Human Rights Watch says the Syrian government is using Soviet-made cluster bombs.
The claims are "untrue," a report from Syria's state-run news agency says.
Cluster bombs release dozens of smaller bombs, which can maim or kill long after impact.
