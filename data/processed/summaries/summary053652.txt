Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti goes to hospital after being hit on head by ball.
He was on the 16th fairway when struck by the shot of France's Alexandre Kaleka.
Play had to be suspended in the first round of the KLM Open in the Netherlands.
Zanotti earlier this year became the first Paraguayan winner on the European Tour.
