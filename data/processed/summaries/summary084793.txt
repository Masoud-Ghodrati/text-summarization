Russia is in the dock over MH17, despite few confirmed facts, says Alexander Nekrassov.
Nekrassov says Ukraine has blamed Moscow for the crash, accusing it of arming rebels.
But he says it would be tough for Kiev to argue how a "rag tag army" could bring down a plane.
The tragedy will hopefully focus international attention on ending the Ukraine bloodshed, he says.
