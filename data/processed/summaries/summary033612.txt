NEW: Legislators call for independent review of the FBI's investigation.
Panel says it cannot say what was the source of the anthrax used in the attacks.
The panel does not offer an opinion on the guilt or innocence of suspect Bruce Ivins.
Ivins, who knew he was under suspicion by the FBI, committed suicide in 2008.
