Fernando Alonso out to erase the painful memory of the 2010 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
Alonso needed a top four finish to win last year's drivers' championship but came seventh.
Instead Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel took the title and has already secured 2011 version.
Alonso heads into this weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix third in the standings.
