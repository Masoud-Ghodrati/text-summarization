NEW: It could be preparations for a test or deception, a South Korean official says.
The reported activity comes just days before President Obama is due to visit Seoul.
Pyongyang said last month that it wouldn't rule out "a new form of nuclear test".
North Korea's last nuclear test in February 2013 was widely condemned.
