Cuba to let U.S. doctor examine Alan Gross, 64, a jailed State Department contractor.
Gross' family says he's in ill health; Cuban officials say he's healthy for his age.
Gross is serving 15 years for bringing banned communications equipment to the island.
Cuba wants to negotiate Gross' fate and that of Cubans in U.S. federal prison for spying.
