Cynthia Good asked son, boys if they would feel left out if called a part of "womankind".
Good's question was to show why women and girls might feel excluded by word "mankind".
Words excluding females seem antiquated now that women are half the workforce, she says.
Good: Phrases that omit a group have no place in organizations valuing diversity.
