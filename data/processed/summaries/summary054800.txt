Debate centers on whether to fix cracks on Tomb of Unknowns or replace it.
Repairing it would cost an estimated $65,000; replacing it would cost $2.2 million.
Cemetery officials want a replica structure; say cheap fixes won't preserve it.
Preservationists say a replica would crack over time, just like the current one.
