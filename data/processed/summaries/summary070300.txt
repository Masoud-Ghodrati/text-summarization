Patrick Stuebing was sent to prison for his incestuous relationship with his sister.
He lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life.
The European Court of Human Rights ruled that Germany was entitled to ban incest.
"We just want to lead a normal life," Stuebing told CNN in a 2007 interview.
