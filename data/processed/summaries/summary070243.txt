Steve Jobs' keynote address will kick off Apple's five-day WWDC conference.
"You won't be disappointed [with my keynote]," said the Apple CEO in an e-mail to a customer.
Gizmodo may have spoiled the surprise by leaking a prototype of the new iPhone.
Apple is also expected to talk about its next-generation mobile operating system.
