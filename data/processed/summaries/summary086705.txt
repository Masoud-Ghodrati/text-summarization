Lee Young-guk was bodyguard to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il for ten years.
He remembers him as a man surrounded by terrified advisors.
Lee was caught trying to escape in 1994 and sent to an infamous prison camp.
He says he fears the current North Korean leader may be even worse than his father.
