A new federal report shows significant performance improvement by major airlines.
Airlines set an 18-year record for on-time performance during the first half of this year.
Meanwhile, complaints rose 24% during the first half of 2012, the report says.
Industry officials say that may be because the DOT has made it easier to file complaints.
