Connecticut's House of Representatives passes an anti-racial profiling law.
The state Senate earlier passed the bill; the governor says he will sign it.
It mandates police bar discrimination in who they stop, detain or search.
Months ago, 4 East Haven police were arrested in a federal racial profiling probe.
