Residents of Isle de la Gonave call their island "the forgotten Haiti".
The island is dependent on Port-au-Prince for money, supplies.
The quake spared island direct hit, but the residents are now cut off from main island.
Island's people are hungry and in need of medical care; U.S. Marines try to help.
