Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer met in New York and were together more than 40 years.
They couldn't legally marry in the U.S., but they did tie the knot in 2007 in Toronto.
When Spyer died, Windsor paid a large inheritance tax -- then fought it in court.
A court rules their union was valid; the Supreme Court will take up the case next year.
