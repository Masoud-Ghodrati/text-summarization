NEW: Police: The sergeant who took photos of Tsarnaev was relieved of duty for one day.
New photos of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev show "the real Boston bomber," photographer says.
The pictures show a bloodied, ashen Tsarnaev emerging from a trailered boat.
It's part of the backlash against Rolling Stone's cover photo of the bombing suspect.
