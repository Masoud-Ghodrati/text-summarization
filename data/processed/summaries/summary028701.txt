NEW: Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo wants his wife to accept his prize, Liu's lawyer says.
"There is reason for every Chinese person to be unhappy," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs says.
Liu has repeatedly called for human rights and democratization.
The prize shows disrespect for China, a spokesman said.
