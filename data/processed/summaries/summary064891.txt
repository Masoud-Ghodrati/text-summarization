Humane Society President Wayne Pacelle says he's open to Michael Vick having a dog.
The star quarterback was sentenced to 23 months for his role in a dogfighting ring.
The author of a book about Vick's dogs doubts his sincerity about loving animals.
Pacelle says Vick would benefit, adding, "Animals have a healing quality to them".
