Peggy Drexler: Wendy Davis, running for governor in Texas, had discrepancies in her bio.
Was she divorced at 19 or 21, did husband help pay for school, how long did she live in trailer/?.
Drexler: In misogynistic attacks, right wing calling her "whore," worse. Men not treated this way.
Drexler: Double-standard smears will help, not hurt.
