Today a ghost town, Namibia's Kolmanskop was once a booming diamond village.
During its peak in the 1920s, it was home to about 340 Europeans and 800 locals.
Access to stretches of the Namib, the world's oldest desert, has been restricted for mining.
A population of feral horses has bred there for generations, becoming an icon of the Namib.
