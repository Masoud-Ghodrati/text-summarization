NEW: A Canadian team has begun searching for cluster balloonist Jonathan Trappe.
Trappe aimed to cross the Atlantic Ocean suspended from 370 helium-filled balloons.
He was just 12 hours and about 470 miles into the journey, his Facebook page says.
He touched down in darkness near a provincial park in the Newfoundland wilderness.
