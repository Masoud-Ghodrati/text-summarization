Ann King is the founder of an Atlanta-based nonprofit group called Save Our Pets Food Bank.
The group provides pet food and medicine to pet owners, who are unable to afford for it.
"No shelter would take me and that dog," says 57-year-old Nadine Turner.
Each year, between 3 million and 4 million cats and dogs in shelters are euthanized.
