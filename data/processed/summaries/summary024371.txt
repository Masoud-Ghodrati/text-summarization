Joseph McStay, his wife and their two boys were reported missing in February 2010.
Their car was found near the Mexican border; their home offered few clues.
A motorcyclist saw their remains this month in desert 100 miles from their home.
McStay's brother promises the family's killers: "We're going to find you".
