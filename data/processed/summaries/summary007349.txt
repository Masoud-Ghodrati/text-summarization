Award-winning novelist Hilary Mantel described the Duchess of Cambridge as "machine-made".
Mantel's comments have sparked criticism, including from UK Prime Minister David Cameron.
Julia Bell argues that Mantel has been misinterpreted by a press wanting headlines.
She says the novelist was asking why Britain needs to "believe in" the royal family.
