A pilot show, "Alpha House," depicts GOP senators in unflattering light.
Julian Zelizer says show makes Republicans out to be hypocrites.
He says the party is perceived to lack authenticity in pushing conservative values.
Zelizer: GOP hasn't shown it is party of fiscal restraint, national security, morality.
