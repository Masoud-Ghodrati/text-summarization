Emily Anderson recreates Alice Ramsey's 1909 coast-to-coast auto odyssey.
Both women made the journey from NYC to San Francisco in a 1909 Maxwell DA.
Passing trucks kicked up debris and wind around the open car during 30-day trip.
Anderson's Maxwell suffered many breakdowns and lots of people helped along the way.
