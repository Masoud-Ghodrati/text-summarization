About 2 trillion tons of ice have melted in Greenland, Antarctica, Alaska since 2003.
Lost amount of water could fill up Chesapeake Bay 21 times, NASA scientist says.
Most came from Greenland, where losses raised global sea levels .5 mm annually.
Scientist says sea levels rising 50 percent faster than 15 years ago.
