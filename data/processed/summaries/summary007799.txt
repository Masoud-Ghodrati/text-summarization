An urban gondola 10.7 kilometers in length is being designed and built in the Bolivian city of La Paz.
Medellin, Rio de Janeiro and Caracas have already installed similar structures as modes of mass city transportation.
Those behind the La Paz project hope it will reduce traffic congestion and connect some of the city's poorest areas.
