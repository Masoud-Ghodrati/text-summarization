State lawmaker Kelli Stargel has proposed a bill calling for parents to be graded.
Parents of kids in kindergarten through third grade would be graded by teachers.
The criteria would include making sure their kids are on time and do their homework.
The bill is getting mixed reviews from parents and teachers.
