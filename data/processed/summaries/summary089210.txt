World No. 2 Tiger Woods has Luke Donald in his sights at WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.
American will return to top if he wins the PGA Tour event for the eighth time.
Woods dropped as low as 58th but third place at British Open continued his steady resurgence.
He will be playing alongside the only other three-time winner of 2012, Branden Grace.
