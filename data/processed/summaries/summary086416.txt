The Lebanese army will get $3 billion from Saudi Arabia, says Lebanon state news agency.
The money could buy weapons from France, according to a statement.
Lebanon's army is not as well equipped as Hezbollah, which is headquartered in Lebanon.
Hezbollah has been supporting Syrian government in civil war.
