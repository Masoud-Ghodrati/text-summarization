The UK Ministry of Defence loses a Supreme Court challenge.
The ruling means the families of three soldiers killed in Iraq can sue for negligence.
The claimants say the Ministry of Defence failed to adequately equip and train soldiers.
Defense secretary says he is concerned the judgment could lead to more litigation.
