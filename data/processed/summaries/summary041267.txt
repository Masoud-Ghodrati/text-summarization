The U.S. shut down Megaupload and announced indictments against seven people.
The site's founder, Kim Dotcom, and three others appear before a New Zealand court.
Dotcom's lawyer says his client denies the charges, criticizing the authorities' approach.
Prosecutors say Dotcom presents an "extreme" flight risk and should not be granted bail.
