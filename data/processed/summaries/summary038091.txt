Thailand and Cambodia agree to implement a court order on a disputed temple.
The deal follows clashes that displaced thousands and killed at least 20.
The International Court of Justice order calls for both sides to withdraw troops.
The countries differ on whether territory around the temple is part of Thailand or Cambodia.
