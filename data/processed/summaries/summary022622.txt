An Indian son finally secures the release of his mother who spent 19 years in jail on bail.
The 19-year-old worked night and day in a garment factory to raise Rs5000 ($89).
The mother was sentenced to life in prison for murder but was released on bail pending an appeal.
The High Court in Uttar Pradesh is now reviewing other bail cases in the state's prisons.
