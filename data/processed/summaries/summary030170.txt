"The Walking Dead" has become popular in part because of its zombie aesthetic.
Greg Nicotero is the man behind the zombies and has worked on the show since Day One.
One character's makeup takes on average about an hour and a half to do.
Extras have to go to "Zombie School" before being cast on the show.
