Preliminary drug and alcohol tests on bus driver came back negative, prosecutors say.
At least 13 people were injured when two tour buses collided in New York's Times Square.
Prosecutors declined to charge driver William Dalambert pending further investigation.
Police had earlier accused Dalambert of driving while impaired.
