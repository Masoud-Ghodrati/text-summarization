Post-Dispatch: Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson testifies for almost four hours.
Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, in Ferguson on August 9.
No charges were filed against Wilson; prosecutors instead took the case to a grand jury.
A judge recently gave the grand jury until January 7 to decide if Wilson should be charged.
