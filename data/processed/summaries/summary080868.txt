William Swenson is the sixth living recipient from the Afghan and Iraq wars.
Swenson was honored for his action on September 8, 2009, in the Ganjgal Valley.
He braved enemy fire to retrieve the bodies of dead soldiers, Obama says.
He criticized his commanders for failing to support soldiers during the battle.
