For the first time in 45 years, Goodyear begins phasing in a new type of airship.
Co-built by Germany's Zeppelin company, it's faster and bigger and has a restroom.
Testing began in March, and the entire fleet will be Zeppelins by 2018.
Although technically it's not a blimp, Goodyear says it will still call it a blimp.
