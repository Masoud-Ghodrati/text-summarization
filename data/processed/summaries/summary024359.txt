Music Hackspace designs, builds and re-purposes instruments.
There are over 1,000 workshops all over the world that 'hack' instruments.
Start-up Dentaku can turn any object - from vegetables to furniture - into an instrument.
Edible instruments have been created, using ice-cream activated by the player's tongue.
