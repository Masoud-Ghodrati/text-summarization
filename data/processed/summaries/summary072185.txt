Dutch architect to create the first building done with 3-D printing.
"Landscape House" would be a huge figure 8 that lets people seamlessly go in and out.
The D-Shape 3-D printer will crank out 20-by-30-foot marblelike blocks for it.
Price is $5 million to $6 million; the architect hopes to finish it in 2014.
