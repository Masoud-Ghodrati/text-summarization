Linda Fondren started Shape Up Vicksburg to help residents of her hometown lose weight.
Mississippi has been the fattest state in the nation for the past six years, a 2009 report says.
Fondren offers free fitness and nutrition classes; she has also started a walking club.
Vicksburg residents have lost 15,000 pounds since Fondren started her mission.
