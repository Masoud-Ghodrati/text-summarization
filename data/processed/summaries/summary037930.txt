Danny Cevallos: The world condemned 16-year-old Texan for defense's use of "affluenza".
He says many objected to the sentence handed out by judge for DUI manslaughter.
Cevallos says defense wasn't using "affluenza" to deny guilt but to help influence sentence.
He says "affluenza" was poor choice of words but refers to a common lack of guidance.
