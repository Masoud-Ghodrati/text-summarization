Peggy Drexler: Employers find a four-day workweek increases productivity and job satisfaction.
She says 86% of American men, 67% of women work more than 40 hours a week.
Drexler: It helps retain all talented workers, not just the women who want to be with kids.
To make it work, employers should put the whole staff on the four-day week, she says.
