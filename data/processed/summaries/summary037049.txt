Teresa Romero Ramos is suing Madrid regional authorities for putting down her dog.
She is also suing the ex-regional health minister, who she says blamed her for falling ill.
"It's clear they were not ready to look after a possible case of Ebola," she says of hospital.
Romero wants to see revised protocols for health workers caring for Ebola patients.
