On October 17, Nigeria's government announced a truce with Boko Haram.
Officials said the deal would see more than 200 girls abducted by the group in April freed.
But a video emerged of Boko Haram's leader denying a truce had been agreed.
Tolu Ogunlesi says the government's election focus allowed it to be hoodwinked.
