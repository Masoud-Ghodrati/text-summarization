NEW: A second, slightly smaller quake hits about 30 minutes later in the same area.
The first, stronger 9-kilometer deep earthquake did not set off tsunami warnings.
It was centered about 550 kilometers (342 miles) north-northeast of Tokyo.
A stronger March 2011 quake triggered a tsunami that led to thousands of deaths.
