Thai police have charged a Lebanese man with illegally possessing explosives.
They will ask a court to extend the period of his detention for further investigation.
The move comes after the U.S. and Israel warned of a terrorist threat in Bangkok.
Thai authorities are accusing the suspect of plotting attacks.
