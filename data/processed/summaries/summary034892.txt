A smoke detector goes off an an Allegiant flight, and all use slides to evacuate safely.
Allegiant then notices its MD-80 planes' slides weren't being overhauled regularly enough.
All 52 of its MD-80s (out of 61 planes total) are immediately taken out of service, checked.
Allegiant is steadily making more planes operational, as well as chartering other aircraft.
