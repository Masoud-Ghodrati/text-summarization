Bob Greene: The acronym for Sioux City's airport has long been a headache.
Greene: The city tried to change it, but FAA would only act if it was a safety issue.
So the city "very successfully made lemonade out of lemons".
Greene: Now you can buy SUX postcards and mugs and proudly wear SUX T-shirts.
