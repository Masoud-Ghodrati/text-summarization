In 2008, Ernie Casillas wore pricey suits, drove a Mercedes and spent without saving.
He lost his job in November of that year and was unemployed for almost four years.
Networking paid off when he crossed paths with the CEO of a green cleaning company.
Casillas says from those years, he's learned to save, be more flexible and less materialistic.
