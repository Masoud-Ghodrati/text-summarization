Egyptian visual artist Nermine Hammam is exhibiting her first solo show in the UK.
She says Egypt's revolution has made her extraordinarily productive.
She has taken more than 70,000 photos of events in Tahrir Square for her work.
It remains to be seen whether there will be an artistic revival in the new Egypt, she says.
