Manufactured sapphire could be on screens for smartphones and tablets.
MIT says the screens would be three times stronger than current displays.
Currently, a sapphire screen costs $30 to make, while Gorilla Glass costs $3.
Gorilla Glass maker Corning says its product is moldable and getting stronger.
