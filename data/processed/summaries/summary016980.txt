Trio of Alcatraz escapees may have survived their journey, study says.
Two brothers and colleague left in June 1962 and were never seen again.
It's likely they perished, but if their timing was right they could have made it, study says.
One person is known to have escaped from Alcatraz while it was a federal pen.
