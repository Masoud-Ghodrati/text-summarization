Shoeless Tiger Woods snored on neighbor's lawn as his wife stood by after car crash.
Neighbor said she was alerted to accident by headlights shining into home from vehicle on lawn.
"She was actually very quiet. Just kind of in shock," neighbor said of Woods' wife.
Neighbors didn't smell alcohol on Woods as they covered him with blanket, gave him pillows.
