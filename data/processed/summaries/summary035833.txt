Convicted for a crime committed at 13, Joe Sullivan appeals to Supreme Court.
He is serving life without parole for burglary and the rape of a 72-year-old woman.
Defense attorneys say punishment for Sullivan, now 33, was too harsh.
The Supreme Court is expected to decide Monday if it will hear the case.
