Louis Perez: U.S. administration has said Cuban democracy is U.S.'s "national interest".
If President Obama wants change in Cuba, he must lift embargo, he says.
While struggling to survive, he says, Cubans have no energy for political reform.
Perez: Lifting embargo would deny Cuba leaders U.S. policy as an excuse.
