NEW: At least 40 students were killed by gunmen who attacked them as they slept.
The attack is the third on schools in the region since June.
No claim of responsibility yet, but a military spokesman says evidence points to Boko Haram.
Since 2009 Boko Haram has targeted schools, churches and police stations.
