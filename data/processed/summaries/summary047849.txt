Rep. Jeff Miller accuses the VA of "what appears to be an attempt to mislead".
Chairman of key House panel says the VA gave questionable information on a fact sheet.
Miller: "VA scandal was created by selfish bureaucrats who lied in order to hide problems".
Robert McDonald is the new VA chief; Eric Shinseki resigned after series of CNN stories.
