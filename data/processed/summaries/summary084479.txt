Prosecutor: 7 Coptic Egyptians are sentenced to death over involvement in an anti-Islam film.
The suspects, accused of being involved with the film's production, are living abroad.
Protests broke out in several Muslim countries in September against the amateurish film.
The man behind it was jailed earlier this month in California in a separate case.
