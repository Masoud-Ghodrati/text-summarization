Kenyan anti-terror police picked up Abdullah Ibrahim el-Faisal days after he passed into country unnoticed.
El-Faisal sentenced in London to 9 years in prison in March 2003 for inciting others to commit murder.
He was paroled in 2007 after serving half his sentence and deported to Jamaica, according to reports.
