Death Cab for Cutie, the Grammy-nominated indie band, has a new EP.
Chris Walla and Nick Harmer discuss the music, their moods and bands they like.
Harmer: "Bittersweet qualities of life" and not "dark brooding" drive songs.
Walla on activism: "You can't do everything all the time. ... Not everybody can be Bono".
