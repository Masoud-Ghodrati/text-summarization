NEW: "American officials would be wise to heed the Italian court's message," ACLU says.
They were found guilty of kidnapping terrorist suspect Abu Omar in 2003 in Milan.
Abu Omar claimed the Americans transferred him to Egypt for torture.
None of the Americans appeared at trial, and extradition has not been requested.
