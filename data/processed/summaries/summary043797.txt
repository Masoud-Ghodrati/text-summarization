EU leaders agree to limit spending to â‚¬908 billion ($1.2 trillion) in a 7-year budget deal.
Herman Van Rompuy says the deal, reached after marathon talks, "was worth working for".
The budget must still be considered by the European Parliament.
The EU has been riven by divisions at a time of austerity.
