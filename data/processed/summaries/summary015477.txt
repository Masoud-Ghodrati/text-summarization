NEW: Chris Kattan tweets "I'm fine, passed all tests, released without bail".
Kattan suffered a bloody nose in the crash, but no workers were in the truck he hit, police say.
"It could have been a lot worse," California Highway Patrol spokesman says.
The actor is suspected to have been under the influence of an unknown drug.
