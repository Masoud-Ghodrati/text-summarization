Mexico arrested Miguel Trevino Morales, leader of the brutal drug cartel The Zetas.
Ruben Navarrette: The arrest is a major coup for new Mexican President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto.
He says Trevino Morales is behind bars, but his brother will take over the cartel.
Navarrette: High-profile arrests put the cartels on notice that they're in the cross hairs.
