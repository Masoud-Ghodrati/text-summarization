Five Syrian refugee families have been flown to Uruguay to begin a new life there.
The group are the first of up to 120 Syrians who will be resettled in the South American country.
Father-of-ten Nassar told CNN he was moving for the sake of his children's education.
"They deserve our help and they deserve the opportunity," said Uruguay's Human Rights Secretary.
