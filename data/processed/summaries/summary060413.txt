Jose Baez wasn't taken seriously until he won acquittals at Casey Anthony's murder trial.
It took Baez eight years to gain admission into The Florida Bar because of debts.
He had been trying cases for just three years when he took the Anthony case.
The late Johnnie Cochran, who won the O.J. Simpson murder trial, is one of his heroes.
