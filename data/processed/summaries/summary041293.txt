John Huttick lost his prosthetic eye while testifying in a court hearing about an assault.
Mathew Brunelli is accused of stabbing Huttick in the eye during a bar fight.
"A bell like that can't be unrung," defense attorney Eileen J. Hurley says.
Judge grants Hurley's request for a mistrial; case is set to be retried March 4.
