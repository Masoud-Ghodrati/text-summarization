World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka will return to the tennis court this weekend.
The Australian Open winner will play for Belarus against the U.S. in the Fed Cup.
Azarenka's first match could be against one of Venus or Serena Williams.
Venus has not played since late August after being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.
