Radovan Karadzic faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity.
Charges stem partly from 1995 mass killing of Muslim men in Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb president at the time, accused of responsibility for the massacre.
He told international tribunal at The Hague that the Serb cause is "just and holy".
