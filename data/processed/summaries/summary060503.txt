South Korean lawmaker Lee Seok-ki has been jailed for 12 years for plotting a rebellion.
Lee was found guilty of leading a secret group of 130 members with alleged links to North Korea.
Lee had denied all charges and his party described the case as a "medieval witch-hunt".
Critics said it was being used to divert attention from claims the 2012 had been manipulated.
