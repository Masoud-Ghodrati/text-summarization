Meredith Lowell is accused of contacting a hit man to kill a random fur-wearer.
She allegedly requested the murder take place at a local library and that she be present.
She said that the target should be at least 12 years old, but "preferably 14 years or older".
Her attorney could not be immediately reached for comment.
