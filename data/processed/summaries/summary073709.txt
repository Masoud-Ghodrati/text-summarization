Elisabeth Kubler-Ross first named 5 grief stages to help with death, says Peggy Drexler.
She says Christie's casting himself as victim, invoking grief stages over scandal, is a first.
Drexler: He spoke of own humiliation, sadness. Left out those affected by traffic tie-up.
Drexler: "Seek sympathy," "blame others" are not stages, but "ask forgiveness" works.
