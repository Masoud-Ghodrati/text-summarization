NEW: Barclays will pay the legal bills of former chief Bob Diamond if necessary, a source says.
Chairman Marcus Agius is giving evidence on a rate-rigging scandal.
Agius says Barclays deeply regretted the circumstances that led to Diamond resigning.
Diamond will still receive a year's salary, the bank says.
