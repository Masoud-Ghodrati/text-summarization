Two Israeli bands -- one Jewish the other Arab -- touring Europe together.
Bands hope their tour will show how music can unite people across political and religious divides.
Other Arab-Israeli musical projects have highlighted power of music to foster peaceful relations.
'The only conflict we have is who is going to pay the bill,' says singer Kobi Farhi.
