Oculus VR has created a virtual reality technology, currently at the prototype stage.
Facebook bought the company in March for over $2 billion.
Brendan Iribe, Oculus VR's CEO, says a consumer version is still "many months" away.
The technology could transform the way we communicate, say its creators.
