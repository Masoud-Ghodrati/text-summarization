A bankruptcy judge rejects a request by Charles "Tex" Watson.
Watson wanted police to only listen to his personal tapes, not take possession of them.
Los Angeles police believe the tapes might have clues about unsolved killings.
In a letter to CNN, Watson says "there are no unsolved murder committed by the Manson Family".
