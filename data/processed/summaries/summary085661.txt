A musical featuring the music of rapper Tupac will open on Broadway in June.
The production, "Holler If Ya Hear Me," is an original, non-biographical story.
The musical takes its title from a song from the late rapper's second solo album.
The show won't tell the story of Tupac, but will use his music and lyrics.
