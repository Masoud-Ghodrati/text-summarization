Journalists haven't been to the Fukushima Daiichi plant since the March 11 quake.
About 3 dozen traveled there by bus Saturday, seeing the damage and recovery firsthand.
A Japanese official says, "I feel conditions have improved".
The plant's chief says a cold shutdown is likely, though it's still dangerous for workers.
