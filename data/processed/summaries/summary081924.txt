Demonstrators rally Saturday in Rabat calling for changes in Morocco's rape laws.
A teen girl committed suicide last week, after a judge said she must marry her alleged rapist.
A rapist is no longer liable if he marries his victim, under Moroccan law.
A government spokesman says, "We cannot ignore this tragedy".
