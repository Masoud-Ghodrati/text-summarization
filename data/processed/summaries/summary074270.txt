Kelley Hardwick, 46, filed a lawsuit on Monday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
She alleges Auriemma followed her to her hotel room and tried to kiss her in 2009.
After he was rebuffed, he demanded that she be removed from her assignment, the lawsuit says.
Auriemma calls the allegations "beyond false," pledging to defend himself "to the fullest".
