"No Guts, No Heart, No Glory" is a play by Common Wealth Theatre that tells the true story of Muslim female boxers.
The performance was partly inspired by former UK national champion Ambreen Sadiq who experienced bullying and discrimination.
"We want to give them a voice and give them a reason, so they know they can have confidence" says cast member Freyaa Ali about girls in boxing.
