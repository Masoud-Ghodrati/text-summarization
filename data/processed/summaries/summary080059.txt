A controversial new cyberlaw has been suspended in the Philippines by the country's top court.
The Cybercrime Prevention Act went into effect on October 3 amidst widespread protests.
Law seeks to address child pornography, identity theft and other computer-related offenses.
Critics of the law are against various provisions of the law, mainly one that criminalizes libel.
