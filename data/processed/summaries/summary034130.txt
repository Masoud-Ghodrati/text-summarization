A South Carolina police officer who knew about DMX's other arrests stopped him Monday.
It was his third run-in with the law in his home state in recent months.
DMX was cited for marijuana possession in Greer, South Carolina, in August.
He was charged with drunken driving, driving without a license in Greenville in July.
