On March 24, an Egyptian court sentenced 529 people to death over violence in the city of Minya.
Last August, a policeman was murdered in riots after a crackdown on pro-Morsy sit-ins.
The sentences need to be approved by Egypt's Grand Mufti and can be appealed.
The length of the trial and severity of the sentences have sparked criticism.
