Male victims of sexual violence during war are less well known than female victims.
Men are subjected to other atrocities as well as rape, says Sandesh Sivakumaran.
Syria's civil war is just one example of where such crimes have been reported.
Research shows men have been victimized in dozens of wars, says Sivakumaran.
