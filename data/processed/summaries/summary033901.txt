In Argentina, authorities called a man's survival in the Andes a miracle.
Now Chilean prosecutors say he's a wanted suspect accused of sexual abuse.
The man lived for four months in the Andes, eating rats and grass to survive.
His family denies the allegations and says he's been missing for months.
