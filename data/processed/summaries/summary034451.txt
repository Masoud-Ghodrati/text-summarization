Michael Garcia wants FIFA to make the findings of report into 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process public.
FIFA said last week it has no plans to publicize the findings of the report.
Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup while Qatar will hold the event in 2022.
American lawyer Garcia says the publication would help FIFA's "reform process".
