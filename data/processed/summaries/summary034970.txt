A Dutch biotech company is developing dandelions for commercial rubber production.
The flowers roots contain latex, a potential source of natural rubber.
The company uses DNA profiling to identify beneficial mutations and "improve" the crop.
It says its methods are different from GM as it does not introduce genes from other species.
