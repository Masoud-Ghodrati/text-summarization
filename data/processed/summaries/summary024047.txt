Michael Amir Williams wants other former Jackson staff to join as a class-action suit.
The lawsuit claims AEG's "acts and omissions brought about the demise of Michael Jackson".
AEG's lawyer calls the suit "clearly frivolous" since Williams has no legal standing to sue.
AEG's "acts and omissions" allegedly involved hiring and supervising of Dr. Conrad Murray.
