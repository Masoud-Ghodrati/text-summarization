Italy's former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is given a four-year sentence for tax fraud.
However, he will serve only one year due to an amnesty cutting down on prison overcrowding.
Berlusconi has 30 days to choose between house arrest or community service.
He will be ineligible to hold public office after he serves this sentence.
