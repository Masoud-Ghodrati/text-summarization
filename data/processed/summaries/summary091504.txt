Health council: "California is experiencing a near public health crisis with STD rates".
Teens in San Diego and Fresno counties are now able to get free condoms delivered by mail.
Youths in five other California counties have already received about 30,000 free condoms.
The program runs on a $5,000 annual budget supported by federal tax dollars.
