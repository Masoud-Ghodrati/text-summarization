Joy Behar: Obama the big, smart kid bullied by Neanderthal ankle-biters in the schoolyard.
Behar: Teachers think: "Why does he take this? He's bigger and smarter" than them.
Behar: Obama elected for change, but so far changing only lapel pins and his mind.
Joy talks politics with "Joe the Plumber" Joe Wurzelbacher on tonight's "Joy Behar" HLN 9 p.m. ET.
