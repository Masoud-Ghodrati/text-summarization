Dog smuggling is booming in Thailand around the Mekong border region with Laos.
Thai authorities say the trade has been growing thanks to a strong market in Vietnam.
Animal welfare groups say operators often pick up strays off the street including pets.
A dog in Thailand can fetch up to $10 but sells for $60 in restaurants in Vietnam.
