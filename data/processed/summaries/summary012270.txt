Author Julien Smith has launched Breather, a concept for distributing space.
Breather allows real estate owners to let their spaces for around $20 an hour.
Starbucks is the closest to a city pit-stop, but around it are likely empty office spaces.
Breather has partnered with Lockitron to create an app which allows access to the space.
