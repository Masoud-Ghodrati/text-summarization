Britain's Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will visit NZ and Australia from April 7 to 25.
A final decision has not been made on Prince George's presence at public events.
Queen Elizabeth II had to give permission for the two heirs to the throne to fly together.
It will be Catherine's first visit to either country, while Prince William first visited in 1983.
