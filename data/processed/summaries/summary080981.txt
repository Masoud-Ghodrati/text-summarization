Mike Lang says his stomach turned when he heard about the Penn State sex abuse scandal.
Syracuse University fired assistant men's basketball coach Bernie Fine on Sunday.
Lang alleges that when he was a boy, Fine touched him inappropriately many times.
Now 45, Lang says he considered Fine a father figure and a "great guy".
