Former tennis star Mark Philippoussis has turned his hand to surfing in California.
Philippoussis won two Davis Cup titles with Australia and reached two grand slam finals.
The 35-year-old last played professionally in 2010 but now has a different focus.
He surfs every day and says he is as dedicated to it as he was to tennis back in the day.
