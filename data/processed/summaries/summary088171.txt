Aaron Miller: For some reason, the Democratic platform omitted Jerusalem, then included it.
The omission gave Romney an opening for questioning Obama's commitment ot Israel, he says.
But Jerusalem is hardly relevant now, he says, with peace talks dead and Iran the main issue.
Miller: Platforms don't matter, and politicians know Jerusalem's fate is not in their hands.
