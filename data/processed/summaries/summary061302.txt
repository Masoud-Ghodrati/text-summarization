Sollecito and Amanda Knox were convicted of murder in Meredith Kercher's 2007 death.
In 2011, they were acquitted but that decision was overturned and a retrial began in 2013.
Sollecito wrote a memoir, "Honor Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox".
He has described his experience as "a nightmare that goes beyond imagination".
