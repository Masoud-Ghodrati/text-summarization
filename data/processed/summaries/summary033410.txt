NEW: President Barack Obama says Robin Williams "was one of a kind".
"He has been battling severe depression of late," his rep says.
Williams was last seen alive at his home, where he lives with his wife, about 10 p.m. Sunday.
Williams underwent rehab drug treatment at least twice, including this summer.
