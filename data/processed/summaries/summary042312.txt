Australian Penny Palfrey, 49, is trying to swim from Havana, Cuba, to the Florida Keys.
She is making attempt without a shark cage or swim aids such as flippers or a wetsuit.
A Lycra suit provides her some protection from jellyfish, her husband says.
A crew of 15, including medical personnel and meteorologists, is shadowing her.
