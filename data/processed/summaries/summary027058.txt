Jill Tarter says the SETI Institute is offering the world raw cosmic data from its telescopes.
She said technology has enabled nonscientists to help search for extraterrestrial life.
When the setiQuest site is fully developed, even kids will be able to search data.
Tarter: More people combing data means a greater possibility of finding signs of life.
