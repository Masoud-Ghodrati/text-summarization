Sen. Mitch McConnell criticizes U.S.-China deal as more of Obama's "ideological war on coal".
Sen. Jim Inhofe says deal unfair and knocks Chinese pledge as "hollow and not believable".
Under the agreement, the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025.
China vows to peak carbon emissions output, produce more energy from renewable sources by 2030.
