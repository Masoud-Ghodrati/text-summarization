Roland Martin: Michael Jordan, aware of his image, kept covered up, even in locker room.
He says Jordan could advise Kate Middleton: In media-obsessed world, cover up.
He says royals can be aghast if they want, but lurid pictures sell and people want to be shocked.
Martin: The world of privacy is gone, not coming back; if you're famous,don't sunbathe naked.
