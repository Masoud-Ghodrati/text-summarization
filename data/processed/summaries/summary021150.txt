A court has thrown out a case against a man accused of taking part in a massacre in France.
SS troops killed 642 residents in the village of Oradour-sur-Glane in June 1944.
Cologne Regional Court said there was no doubt the massacre occurred.
But it said that it was unlikely the case against the pensioner, 89, would be provable.
