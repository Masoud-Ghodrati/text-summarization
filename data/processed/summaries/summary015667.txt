A transsexual woman has won on appeal the right to marry her boyfriend in a landmark case.
She was refused the right to marry as she did not quality as a "woman" under Hong Kong law.
The 37-year-old, known as 'W,' had a sex change operation more than five years ago.
Judges noted the decision does not address the question of same-sex marriage.
