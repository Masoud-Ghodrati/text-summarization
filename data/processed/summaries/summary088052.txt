John Daly welcomes troubled No. 1 Tiger Woods back to the fray for this week's Masters.
Woods held his first post-scandal open news conference at Augusta on Monday.
Daly, who has had his own marital problems, said Woods did not need to apologize to media.
He said Woods' toughest task would be off the course, keeping his family together.
