New York City asks appeals court to drop ruling requiring changes to stop-and-frisk.
U.S District Judge Shira A. Scheindlin issued ruling, said policy unfairly targeted minorities.
She was removed from the case in October because of bias, appeals panel said.
Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio has said he would drop the city's appeal of Scheindlin's ruling.
