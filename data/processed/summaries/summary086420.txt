Camp Twitch and Shout is a weeklong camp for kids with Tourette syndrome.
Fifty campers, between 7 and 18, came from all over the country to Georgia camp.
Three out of every 1,000 school-age children have disorder, according to CDC.
Camper: "It's very nice to be able to let it all out and just not have to worry".
