Bob Greene asks: What would life in U.S. be like if there were no minimum wage.
For most of U.S. history, there was no minimum wage; it started in 1938 under FDR.
Obama wants to raise it. Others, like Speaker Boehner, oppose it as costly to business.
Greene: With minimum wage nation tells workers: What you do has value worth protecting.
