An investigative journalist in Azerbaijan is under fire for a sexually explicit video.
The video was recorded via hidden camera and posted online to defame her.
Khadija Ismayilova believes the government is behind the smear campaign.
The government denies this and has blamed it on 'subversive forces'.
