An advert showing a white woman feeding a black boy like a dog has run in South Africa.
The ad ends with "the average domestic dog eats better than millions of children".
Feed a Child withdrew its ad and issued an apology for any offense caused.
The Advertising Standards Authority has since ruled that no formal action needed to be taken.
