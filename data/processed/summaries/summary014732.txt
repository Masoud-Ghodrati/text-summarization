NEW: Lawyers for Pussy Riot condemn the murders, say the band backed peaceful protest.
Investigators: The words "Free Pussy Riot" are scrawled on a wall above two murder victims.
The bodies are those of a 76-year-old woman and her daughter, investigators say.
Three members of the punk band Pussy Riot were sentenced to prison terms this month.
