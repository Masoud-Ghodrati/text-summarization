More than 1.5 million people are eligible to vote in 36 municipalities for mayors and assembly members in Kosovo.
Kosovo has long been a restive province of Serbia with a majority ethnic Albanian population.
Serbs and ethnic-Albanians fought a brutal war in the late 1990s, which ended after NATO bombing of Serbia.
Ethnic-Albanians eventually declared the province independent in February 2008, but Serbia opposed the move.
