Irina Bokova: The destruction of Timbuktu's shrines adds a moral and cultural crisis to a desperate humanitarian situation.
She says the attack is an attempt to isolate and exclude, to sever the ties that bind peoples together.
"We need a new leap of global solidarity today, starting in Timbuktu," she says.
