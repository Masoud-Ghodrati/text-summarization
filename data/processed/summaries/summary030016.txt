A Chevron natural gas well exploded last week, killing one worker and injuring another.
Chevron says "around the clock" efforts continue to shut the well.
Meanwhile, 100 certificates for free pizza are sent by Chevron to residents.
One resident tweets: "Worst apology ever: Sorry our ... well exploded. Here's a free pizza".
