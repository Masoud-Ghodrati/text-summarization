Tiger Woods says there hasn't been time for a clear-the-air talk with Sergio Garcia.
Garcia said he'd apologize face-to-face for 'fried chicken' comment he made about Woods.
The pair were pictured shaking hands on Monday but haven't met again.
Garcia reveals he left a note for Woods in his locker at Merion.
