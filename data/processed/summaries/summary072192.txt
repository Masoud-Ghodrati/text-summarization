Pepper Schwartz: Why did Huma Abedin stand by husband in new sexual scandal?.
She says it's likely a combination of things: her ambition for her husband, faith in marriage vows.
She says Abedin may believe a woman stands by her man and wants to preserve her family.
Schwartz: Abedin may be in "tending and befriending" mode -- Weiner doesn't deserve her.
