China's J-15 jet completed its first landing on the aircraft carrier Liaoning, Xinhua says.
The Liaoning is built in the shell of an abandoned Soviet carrier.
The Liaoning aircraft carrier will be able to carry 30 J-15 fighter planes, Chinese media reports.
The U.S. predicts it will be years before China's carrier has a minimal level of combat capability.
