Fishermen have taken 37 bottlenose dolphins to be sold into captivity, conservationists say.
Many of the 200 dolphins still in the cove in Taiji, Japan, will be slaughtered, they say.
Local officials have previously defended hunting of dolphins as a traditional practice.
Environmental activists say dolphin meat contains dangerously high levels of mercury.
