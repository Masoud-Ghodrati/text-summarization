The FBI says it is increasing the reward for missing American Robert Levinson to $5 million.
Levinson, a former FBI agent, went missing in Iran eight years ago; Iran says it does not know where he is.
Secretary of State John Kerry has issued a statement asking for Iran to cooperate in the search for Levinson.
