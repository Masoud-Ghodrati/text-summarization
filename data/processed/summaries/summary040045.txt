The Army-Navy game on Saturday marks the 120th anniversary of the football rivalry.
Nicolaus Mills: Both academies made sure the rivalry was consistent with military values.
The game has become tradition for Americans and an antidote to dark times, Mills writes.
Mills: Army-Navy players don't go directly to NFL or a lucrative job, but to active service.
