Upper house of parliament OKs ban on adoptions of Russian children by U.S. families.
Lawmakers in Russia's lower house of parliament adopted the bill last week.
The move is seen as retaliation for the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law that restricts rights abusers.
But backers of the Russian bill say American adoptive parents have been abusive.
