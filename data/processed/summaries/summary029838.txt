A boy, then 10, fatally shot his father in 2011 as he was sleeping on a couch.
The father was a leader in the National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi group.
Prosecutors argued domestic issues, not the dad's background, led to death.
A judge finds it "true" the boy committed murder and understood it was wrong.
