English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar.
But the Liverpool captain says in court testimony that it was in self-defense.
Gerrard, 29, denies charge of affray for attacking businessman Marcus McGee.
If found guilty, he faces maximum penalty of six months in jail and $7,200 fine.
