Anti-apartheid hero Nelson Mandela laid to rest in his childhood village.
Funeral and burial ended 10 days of mourning for South Africa's first black president.
More than 4,000 people gathered at Mandela's funeral service in a tent in the Qunu hills.
His family told CNN's Robyn Curnow they believed his spirit was now at home.
