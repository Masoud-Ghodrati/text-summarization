Obama: North Korea's release of Americans didn't involve major talks on pressing issues.
The U.S. "welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China," Obama says.
He announces an agreement with Beijing to extend the maximum length of visas.
The U.S. President will visit Myanmar and Australia later this week.
