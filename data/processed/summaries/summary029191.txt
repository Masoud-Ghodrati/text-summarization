Pope Benedict's resignation leaves the church and the world in unfamiliar, but not entirely uncharted, territory.

He was unable to hit the right note when it came to addressing the priest sex abuse scandal.
It seems likely this careful theologian and prototypical company man will fade quietly from public view.
