TED got its start as a conference in Monterey, California, 30 years ago.
Today the organization has a big media footprint, with 1,600-plus talks available online.
Many predictions made on its stage have come true, including popularity of touch screens.
Speakers at this week's conference include Bill Gates, Sting, and Tim Berners-Lee.
