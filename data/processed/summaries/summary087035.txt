Marathon runner Haile Gebrselassie is one of Ethopia's most celebrated athletes.
He's aiming to break the world marathon record he set in Berlin in 2007 this year.
He's contesting the 10,000 meters in Beijing Olympics but doesn't expect to win.
Gebrselassie: "If I won bronze, fine. Even if I don't compete, I don't mind".
