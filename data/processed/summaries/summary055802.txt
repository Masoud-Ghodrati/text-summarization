NEW: "Randy Travis is out of surgery and in critical condition," the hospital says.
Travis' stroke is "a complication of his congestive heart failure".
Doctors implanted a device in his heart to help blood flow.
His illness is related to his "recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy," his publicist says.
