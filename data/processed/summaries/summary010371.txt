"Twilight" author Stephenie Meyer reveals her inspiration for the book.
"I really had gotten into that zombie mom way of doing things ..." before a dream.
Nine people rejected her book, five ignored it, one said "I'd like to read more".
Coven of vampires added to "New Moon" after her mom suggested more action at end.
