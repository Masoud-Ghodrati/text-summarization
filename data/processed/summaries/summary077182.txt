With no atmosphere, cloudy weather or even night, space is a perfect place to build our solar power stations.
The concept has been around since the 1940s when science fiction posited the idea of a robot-manned power station.
Some variants could provide as much as 1GW of energy beamed to receivers on Earth -- enough to power a large city.
Some scientists say only the cost of putting payloads in space is preventing the idea becoming a reality.
