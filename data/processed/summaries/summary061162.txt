Police say Crocker hit a vehicle, spun out, then drove away from the scene.
Ryan Crocker has been U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Syria, Pakistan, Iraq and other nations.
He left as U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan in July for "health reasons," officials said.
In August, he was charged with hit-and-run and drunken driving in Spokane, documents show.
