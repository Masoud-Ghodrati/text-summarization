NEW: Rand Paul says he'll take part in a Monday night debate that he'd threatened to pull out of.
Jack Conway's ad accuses Paul of once belonging to a group that mocked religion.
Paul says that Conway should be ashamed and that he's never been un-Christian.
Conway says he'll run more issue-oriented spots but defends the "Aqua Buddha" ad.
