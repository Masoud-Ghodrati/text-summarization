David Bianculli notes Gov. Chris Christie is in news for "Jersey Shore" decision.
Christie denied show tax credit because it fed "misperceptions"about state.
Bianculli says pols have weighed in before, but why "Shore" and not "Sopranos"?.
Bianculli: Maybe new policy should be tax credits for quality shows, fines for tacky ones.
