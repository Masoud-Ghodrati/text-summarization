NEW: Lohan wasn't at nightclub where the incident allegedly happened, her publicist says.
"It's just an allegation," a sheriff's deputy says.
Publicist: "You have to wonder about someone who calls the media before the police".
A judge advised Lohan to "stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work" last month.
