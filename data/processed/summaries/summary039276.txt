Howard Kurtz: Media saying Obama is running into the "second-term curse".
He says it's true Obama's running into trouble, but pundits' rush to judgment premature.
Second-termers (see Reagan, Bush, Clinton) have successes along with stumbles, he says.
Kurtz: Obama does face wind down of sway; this could affect his impact more than errors.
