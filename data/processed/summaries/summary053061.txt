Billionaire T. Boone Pickens says the U.S. should establish a federal "wind bank".
The federally funded loan program would finance large-scale wind developments.
Pickens spoke Wednesday at the Clean-Tech Investor Summit in California.
His plan calls for spending $150 billion to install wind turbines in the Midwest.
