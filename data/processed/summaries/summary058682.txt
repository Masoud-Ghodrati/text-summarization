Three Connecticut teens, ages 17 and 18, are accused of having sex with two girls, 13.
In Connecticut, it is illegal for a teen to have sex with a minor more three years younger.
The investigation began when the parents of one of the alleged victims called the police.
As the case became public, one alleged victim was criticized on Twitter by other teens.
