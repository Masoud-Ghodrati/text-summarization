The 1972 movie "Deliverance" was shot in Rabun County, Georgia.
The film spurred hard-to-shake stereotypes of "ignorant" and "deviant" mountain dwellers.
"Deliverance" also generated huge tourism dollars for the northwest Georgia county.
Real estate agent: "Once people come to Rabun County, they don't want to leave".
