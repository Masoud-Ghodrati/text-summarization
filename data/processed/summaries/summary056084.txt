David Frum: People often neglect the economic reasons behind the choice to have an abortion.
He says those trying to reduce abortion need an answer to how to help women in need.
Frum: Abortion rates fell in 1990s economic boom.
Germany, which has generous maternity benefits, has much lower abortion rate, he says.
