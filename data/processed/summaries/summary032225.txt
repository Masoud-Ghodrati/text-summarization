Sandra Guzman: Dolores Prida, advice columnist, "Latina Dear Abby," died at 69.
She says Guzman was Renaissance woman: playwright, activist, feminist.
Her plays spoke to Latina experience in U.S.; Her advice columns were wise, frank, witty.
Guzman: Her last hours were joyous, spent with friends; she brought many joy and light.
