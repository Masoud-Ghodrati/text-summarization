Video shows a man identified as ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi speaking at a mosque.
If it's actually al-Baghdadi, it would be one of his first known appearances on video.
Iraqi and U.S. experts are analyzing the video, which surfaced on social media sites.
Days earlier, unconfirmed reports said al-Baghdadi had been killed or wounded.
