Filipino boxer Pacquiao has had his assets in his homeland frozen.
Philippines tax authorities are seeking proof he paid $50 million in taxes on U.S. earnings.
Pacquiao's promoter says he is seeking documentation from U.S. tax authorities.
The freeze has delayed the boxer from delivering promised typhoon relief.
