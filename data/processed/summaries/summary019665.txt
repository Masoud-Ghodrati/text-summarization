Pfc. Bradley Manning is accused in the largest leak of classified documents in U.S. history.
In February, he pleaded guilty to 10 of the 22 charges against him.
He did not plead guilty to the most serious charge -- that of aiding the United States' enemies.
Manning's supporters rallied at Maryland's Fort Meade on Saturday.
