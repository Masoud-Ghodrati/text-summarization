Former lover of billionaire Nina Wang, Peter Chan, sentenced to 12 years' jail for forgery.
Chan, 53, claimed he was employed as a feng shui master by Wang to find her missing husband.
He claimed Wang's will had made him the main beneficiary of her $4 billion fortune.
Justice Andrew Macrae in sentencing describes Chan as a "clever and beguiling charlatan".
