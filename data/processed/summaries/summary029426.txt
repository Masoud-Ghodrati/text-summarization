Lisa Baldez: It's easy to assume the United States is at the forefront of women's rights.
Year after year, she says, the U.S. refuses to ratify a U.N. pact supporting women's equality.
Baldez: 187 nations signed; 7 nations including Iran, Somalia, Sudan, Tonga haven't.
Treaty reflects U.S. values; Republicans once backed women's rights more, she says.
