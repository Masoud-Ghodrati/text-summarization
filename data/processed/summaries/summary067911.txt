Former Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Rick Santorum ran for the nomination in 2012; might run again.
Santorum is very much keeping his name in the 2016 mix by visiting critical early primary states.
This time around he's making early connections with establishment leaders in the early states.
Santorum recently packed a lot of activity into a 36-hour visit to South Carolina.
