Police chief says there will be no updates until after Friday's autopsy.
Leanne Hecht Bearden had recently returned to the U.S. after a 22-month global trek.
Bearden's family is "understandably devastated" and "we will all miss her greatly".
She was last seen January 17, leaving her in-laws' house in Texas for a walk.
