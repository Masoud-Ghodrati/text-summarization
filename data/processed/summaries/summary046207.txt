2011 TED Fellow Sumit Dagar is developing the world's first smartphone for visually impaired people.
The phone's screen contains pins which move to form Braille characters when an SMS or email is received.
It uses Shape Memory Alloy technology which ensures pins contract back to their original position.
The phone will retail for about $185, and the team hopes to release it by the end of 2013.
