Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary tops the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of most-wanted Nazis.
Center says he participated in sending 15,700 Jews to Auschwitz in spring 1944.
Csizsik-Csatary denied the allegations to British tabloid The Sun.
The center says eyewitnesses on three continents describe acts of cruelty.
