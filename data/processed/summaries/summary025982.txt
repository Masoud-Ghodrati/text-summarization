The 32-year-old self-effacing golf champion has become a national hero in Australia.
Born in Adelaide in 1980, Scott showed early promise as a professional golfer.
His father, also a golf professional, perfected his easy and straightforward swing.
Scott's victory is seen as avenging Australian golfing great Greg Norman's defeat in 1996.
