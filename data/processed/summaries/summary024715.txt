Darren Young made the revelation in an impromptu interview on TMZ late Wednesday.
"I'm gay. And I'm happy," he said when asked whether a gay wrestler could succeed in WWE.
WWE says it is "proud of Darren Young for being open about his sexuality".
Young was expected to participate in an anti-bullying event in Los Angeles on Thursday.
