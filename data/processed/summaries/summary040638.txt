World Economic Forum's new Gender Gap Index gives India a dismal scorecard.
134th out of 142 in the world for economic opportunities; 126th for educational attainment.
Women are born at a disadvantage, enjoying far few opportunities than men.
Gender gap may help to explain poor treatment of women, including issues such as security, rape.
