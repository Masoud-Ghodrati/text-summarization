Two suspects have been arrested on suspicion of torching a mosque in northern Israel, the police say.
The second suspect, an 18-year-old, is scheduled to appear in court, the police say.
The mosque was set on fire and scrawled with graffiti in an apparent "price tag" attack.
Residents angered over the mosque attack, blocked the road and hurled rocks at police, authorities say.
