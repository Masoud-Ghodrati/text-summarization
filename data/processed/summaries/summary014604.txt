Manny Pacquiao loses his WBO welterweight crown to American Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas.
Two judges rule the fight 115-113 for American, while the other judge backs the Filipino champion.
The decision is greeted with a chorus of boos by fans who thought Pacquiao had dominated.
The two fighters may return to the ring for a rematch later this year, reports say.
