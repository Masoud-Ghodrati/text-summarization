Steven Robles is weak and sore after the shark attack at Manhattan Beach, California.
"Pure instinct" kicked in when he came face to face with the shark, Robles says.
He "just happened to be a the wrong place at the wrong time," lifeguard says.
Swimmer says going back into the water "is not on the table".
