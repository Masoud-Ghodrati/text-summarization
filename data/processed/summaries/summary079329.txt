Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed bill that would give businesses right to refuse to serve gays.
Rocco DiGrazia's pizzeria sign: "We reserve the right to refuse service to Arizona legislators".
He says not long ago, blacks, Indians and Chinese were discriminated against in Arizona.
DiGrazia was sure Brewer would veto; it would hurt Arizona businesses if it became law.
