Charles Garcia: Supreme Court majority was wise to avoid term "illegal immigrant".
The term suggests that individuals, rather than actions, are unlawful, he says.
He says foreign nationals residing unlawfully in the U.S. are not criminals.
Repetition of phrases like "illegal immigrant" is like a poison that infects society, Garcia says.
