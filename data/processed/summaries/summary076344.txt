3 million U.S. citizen children are believed to have one undocumented parent.
Julie Quiroz, 13, was born in the U.S. but had to return to Mexico with her mom.
"I never belonged there ... I'd just come home, sit down, cry," she says.
Thanks to a philanthropist, Quiroz was able to come back to study; but without mother.
