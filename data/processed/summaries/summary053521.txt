Mukesh Kapila was the United Nations' top official in Sudan in 2003.
Since that year, an estimated 300,000 Darfuris have been killed or died.
He says a U.N. monitor's warning of violence "disappeared into a big hole".
Kapila says atrocities could have been prevented if the world had taken action sooner.
