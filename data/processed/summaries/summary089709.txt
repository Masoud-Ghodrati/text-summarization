The Franciscan manzanita is a flowering shrub found only on San Francisco peninsula.
It has been believed extinct since 1947.
A highway construction project removes trees covering the plant; passing biologist notices it.
The plant and its 11-ton root ball are relocated; feds put shrub on endangered list.
