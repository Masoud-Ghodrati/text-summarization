Asiana Airlines says pilot error was partly to blame in last year's crash.
The airline also cites auto throttle problems and inadequate warning systems.
Three people died after the plane hit the seawall at San Francisco International Airport.
The airline says the flight crew failed to execute a "timely go-around" when needed.
