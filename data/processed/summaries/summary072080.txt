Rep. Joe Wilson was criticized by both parties for his outburst during 2009 Obama speech.
He apologized at the time, calling his comment "inappropriate and regrettable".
He'll sit with two Democrats during Tuesday's State of the Union address, spokesman says.
Reps. Susan Davis of California and Madeleine Bordallo of Guam invited Wilson to sit with them.
