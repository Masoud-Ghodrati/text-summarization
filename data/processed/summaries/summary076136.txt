WBA heavyweight champion David Haye is to fight ex-Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison.
All-British clash is to take place on November 13 in Manchester.
The pair used to be friends before a public war of words erupted last year.
Haye says fans have been begging him to finish Harrison's career once and for all.
