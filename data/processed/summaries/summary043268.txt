NEW: Campbell "realizes that he cannot handle the extremely long travel that is required," rep says.
Glen Campbell, 76, will perform the final shows on his U.S. tour this month and in October.
Campbell began the world tour last year after he went public with his Alzheimer's diagnosis.
His family surrounds him on the stage to help in case he becomes disoriented.
