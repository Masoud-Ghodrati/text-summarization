FIFA states that European clubs will not receive any compensation following the proposal to play the 2022 World Cup in November-December..

Frenchman says Qatar will not host the Confederations Cup, often labeled the World Cup warm-up, in 2021.
2023 Africa Cup of Nations will be played in June, adds Valcke.
