Goldman Sachs granted $65 million in stock to execs before new tax rates began.
Susan Antilla says the firm's CEO had endorsed higher rates, called for entitlement cuts.
She says Goldman benefits from the implicit promise that U.S. will bail it out.
Antilla: It was unseemly for Goldman to rush the payments to shield execs from new rates.
