Mahmoud Sarsak's protest at an Israeli prison entered its 80th day Wednesday.
He has been held without charge since July 2009.
Israeli authorities say he's a dangerous extremist, and his strike has stopped and restarted.
But his family says he's not a militant, and rights activists worry about his health.
