NEW: St. James' Palace: "We have made our views on Prince Harry's privacy known".
The Sun is the first mainstream UK newspaper to publish the photographs.
It says there is "a clear public interest" argument for their publication.
Prince Harry was in a hotel suite in Las Vegas when the naked snaps were taken.
