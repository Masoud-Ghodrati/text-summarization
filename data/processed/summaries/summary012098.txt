The vaquita, a small porpoise that lives in Gulf of California, Mexico, is near extinction.
Omar Vidal, Robert L. Brownell Jr. and Zhou Kaiya: Fewer than 100 vaquitas remain.
They say Mexican, U.S. and Chinese governments must take swift and coordinated action.
One way is if Mexico stops the illegal fishing of totoaba, which often ensnares vaquitas.
