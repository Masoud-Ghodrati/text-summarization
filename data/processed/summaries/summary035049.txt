CDC: There have been no reports of pets getting sick with Ebola or spreading it.
But some studies have shown dogs can have the virus, but not be sick from it.
An Ebola patient's dog in Dallas is quarantined after a patient's dog in Spain was euthanized.
"The problem is we haven't really studied the progress of Ebola in dogs," a professor says.
