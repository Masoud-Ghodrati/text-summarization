St. Francis of Assisi is a patron saint of Italy and founder of brown-robed Franciscans.
"Who doesn't know Francis of Assisi," Vatican spokesman says.
St. Francis "was also rightly spoken of as 'another Jesus Christ,'" Pope Pius XI said.
He renounced the inheritance of his rich cloth merchant father.
