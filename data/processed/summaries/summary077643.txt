Barak Barfi: As airstrikes against ISIS fail, Washington should look to Syrian Kurds.
ISIS is strongest force in northern, eastern Syria, he says; Islamist rivals are weakened.
He says Kurds eager to fight, can supply the kind of order ISIS brings to conquered cities.
Barfi: Don't rely on Free Syrian Army; Kurds' objectives more in line with D.C.'s.
