Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Rick Perry has hitched his wagon to Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.
Perry was foolishly looking for quick validation from his party's nativist fringe, Navarrette says.
Justice Department has accused Arpaio of discrimination and racial profiling, he says.
A once-promising candidate has lost his bearings, Navarrette says of Perry.
