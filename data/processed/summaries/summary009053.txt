The French Senate voted to ban child beauty pageants for kids under 16.
Lawmakers in France argue the pageants sexualize girls at a young age.
Many Americans think pageants for very young girls should be outlawed.
Pageant supporters say girls develop self-esteem, confidence and other skills that last a lifetime.
