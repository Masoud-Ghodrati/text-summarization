Manchester United defender found guilty of improper conduct and fined by English Football Association.
Ferdinand commented on a tweet which had referred to Ashley Cole as a "choc ice".
Cole was a character witness for John Terry at a court hearing which alleged he racially abused Ferdinand's brother Anton.
Terry cleared by London court in July but is awaiting fate of improper conduct charges by FA.
