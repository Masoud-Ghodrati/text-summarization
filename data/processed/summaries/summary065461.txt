A U.S. official says they know of "no succession plan" now that bin Laden is dead.
An expert says his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is "not popular with colleagues".
Another contender is U.S.-born Anwar al-Alwaki, who is now based in Yemen.
Other possibilities are Abu Yahya al-Libi, from Libya, and Ilyas Kashmiri of Pakistan.
