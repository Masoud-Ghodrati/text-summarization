NEW: U.S. secretary of state calls for Aung San Suu Kyi's release.
Suu Kyi's lawyer blames charges on American who allegedly stayed in her house.
She is said to have let John Yettaw stay, in violation of her house-arrest terms.
Supporters say action is an excuse to extend restrictions on her movement.
