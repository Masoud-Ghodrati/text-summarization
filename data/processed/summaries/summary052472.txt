"African Cats" is a new film documenting the lives of Kenya's lions and cheetahs.
The filmmakers spent more than two years following the great cats as they struggled to survive.
During the course of filming, they got to know the distinct personalities of their subjects.
They hope the film, billed as a "real-life Lion King," will spur audiences' interest in conservation.
