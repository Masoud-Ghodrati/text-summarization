Babette Beatty was on the January 20, 1964, cover of Sports Illustrated.
Beatty, a New York-based model, says the first swimsuit shoot was just another job.
She fondly remembers her shoot as a wild time hanging out with the Mexican air force.
She now lives in Halfway, Oregon, population 350, running an art gallery.
