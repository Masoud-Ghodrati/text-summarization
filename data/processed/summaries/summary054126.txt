Tiffany Hawk shocked TSA soon will allow air passengers to carry some small knives.
Hawk: There is a reason knives were banned before -- they made the 9/11 attacks possible.
She says passengers and flight attendants are at risk if someone wields a knife.
Hawk: Faster and easier checkpoints needed, not backward and absurd policies.
