New Jersey's largest firefighters union is now looking to honor Sandy hook victims.
Firefighters have begun collecting donations for "The Sandy Ground Project".
26 playgrounds are to be built in communities recovering from the storm.
Each playground is for a victim gunned down on December 14 at school in Connecticut.
