Ruben Navarrette: A debate broke out over race and Oklahoma killing.
He says people raised race in the wake of the national debate over Zimmerman case.
In both cases, it's unknown if the victims were targeted because of race, he says.
Navarrette: The media needs to avoid tailoring its reporting to political or social goals.
