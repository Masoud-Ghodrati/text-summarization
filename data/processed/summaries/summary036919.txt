NEW: The Japan Meteorological Agency lifts any tsunami-related warnings or advisories.
Earlier, the agency had said "there is a very small possibility" of a tsunami.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and Australia's similar agency reports no such threats.
The earthquake hits 81 miles east of Wewak, New Guinea, says the U.S. Geological Survey.
