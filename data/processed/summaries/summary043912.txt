'Copper' is a period detective drama set in 1865 and based on early forensic methods.
Costuming for the show is done by team of cutters, sewers, dyers, cobblers and milliners.
Head costumer Delphine White consulted historical records to get the look right.
White also incorporated more modern colors and cuts to give costumes a unique flair.
