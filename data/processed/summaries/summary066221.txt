The woman, Jameela Barnette, was killed as she tried to attack an officer, police said.
She had been charged with sending threatening packages to two lawmakers.
Both packages contained threatening letters and one contained a hoax WMD.
U.S. Rep. Peter King and New York State Sen. Greg Ball received the packages.
