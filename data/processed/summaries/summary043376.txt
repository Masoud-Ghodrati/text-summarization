Artillery fire and blaring horns commemorate Kim Jong Il's life.
Speeches at the ceremony proclaim his son Kim Jong Un as 'supreme leader'.
The service takes place a day after the elder Kim's three-hour funeral procession.
His death earlier this month has created uncertainty about the country's stability.
