Some young students in China are using their graduation photos to project their individuality.
Posted on social media, photos show students with provocative signs or running naked through their campus.
Critics say they excessively pursue unconventional and new things in order to be different.
But others say this is a result of students starting to enjoy the same personal freedoms as their peers abroad.
