A woman rescued from a Ishinomaki building says, "I'm so scared -- I am panicked".
She, like many others, have not been able to locate loved ones after the tsunami.
Rescue teams in rowboats have brought in hundreds of survivors in that city alone.
Japan's prime minister has said at least 15,000 have been rescued, a report says.
