Prita Mulyasari sent email to friends complaining a Jakarta hospital misdiagnosed her illness.
Hospital got hold of her email and reported her to police, pressing charges of defamation.
Court ruled in hospital's favor and ordered her to pay more than US$20,000 in damages.
Bloggers began "A Coin for Prita" campaign to help pay off Prita's fine; Prita vows to appeal.
