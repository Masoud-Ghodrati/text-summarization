A new book, "Her Next Chapter," explores the benefits of mother-daughter book clubs.
Author Lori Day started one in 2000 when her daughter was 8.
She says the clubs can help girls deal with issues such as bullying and sexualization.
The book clubs also become a support system for other moms, she says.
