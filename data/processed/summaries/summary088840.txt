Isrrael Galindo is believed to be the only U.S.-based parent of any of the 43 missing students.
He hopes his 19-year-old son and the 42 other students are still alive.
"I want him to know that I love him," he weeps, "I want him alive".
Other parents and many in Mexico are in an uproar over an apparent atrocity.
