British government loses its latest bid to deport Abu Qatada, also known as Omar Othman.
Home Secretary Theresa May has until April 17 to appeal the ruling.
The radical cleric is accused of funding terrorist groups and inspiring one of the 9/11 hijackers.
Abu Qatada denies the allegations against him and has long fought his deportation to Jordan.
