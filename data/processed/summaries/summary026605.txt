Ruben Navarrette: Texas governor orders National Guard troops to the border.
He says they won't be apprehending border crossers but will be in a support role.
Bush used National Guard twice in his presidency to help deal with border issues.
Navarrette: The scene on the border isn't an invasion, but desperate people seeking help.
