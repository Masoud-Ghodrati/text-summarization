James Cochran, known as "Jimmy C," painted an outdoor portrait of athlete Usain Bolt.
Cochran has a background in graffiti art and academic arts training.
He is based in east London's Shoreditch, which is a hub for the city's street artists.
Cochran painted the mural in the hope it would last beyond the Olympic Games.
