Sudha David-Wilp says the North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) vote can portend national change.
Brussels will be watching because Germany is the power broker with the EU, she says.
David-Wilp: The appearance of new parties could herald instability within Germany.
She adds that the NRW vote will have an impact on Germany's future role in Europe.
