Travolta's lawyer challenges details of the alleged Beverly Hills Hotel incident on January 16.
The actor was in New York from January 15 for several days, his lawyer says.
People "from every state" are calling to join the lawsuit, says lawyer who filed it.
Travolta must testify in public and on camera unless he settles the suit, the lawyer says.
