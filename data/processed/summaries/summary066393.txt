Former Lotus boss Peter Warr died of a heart attack on Monday aged 72.
Bernie Ecclestone has led tributes to Warr, who became team manager at Lotus in 1969.
He had previously been a driver for Lotus, winning the Japanese Grand Prix in 1963.
Warr attended the Bahrain GP in March, which saw Lotus return to F1 after six years.
