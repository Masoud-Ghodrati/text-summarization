Disabled punk bank Heavy Load have launched the "Stay Up Late" campaign.
The band want disabled concert-goers to be able to enjoy gigs until the end.
Disabled people often have to leave gigs early when their carers' shifts end.
Heavy Load played last week at a London club night run by disabled people.
