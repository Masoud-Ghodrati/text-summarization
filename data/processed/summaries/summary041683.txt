French justice officials say there is a clear prison "overpopulation problem".
Redoine Faid was a wanted criminal in the '90s known for attacking armored trucks.
Faid held guards at gunpoint and used explosives to burst through a prison's doors.
Law enforcement in France and elsewhere in Europe are now hunting for him.
