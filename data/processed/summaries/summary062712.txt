Rebecca Coriam disappeared from a Disney cruise ship in March.
168 people have vanished from cruise ships and ferries in international waters since 1995.
Missing persons at sea must be investigated by the country where the ship is registered.
Coriam's parents want new laws to protect cruise passengers in Europe.
