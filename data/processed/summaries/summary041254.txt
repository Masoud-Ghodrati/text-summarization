Omar Gonzalez jumped a fence, made it in the White House before getting caught.
The Secret Service interviewed him twice before that incident, an official says.
Once came after a July arrest on a gun charge; he also had a White House map.
The other was in August, after being stopped with a hatchet outside the White House.
