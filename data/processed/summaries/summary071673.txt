Drew Olanoff has placed his Twitter username up for auction to benefit charity.
Drew Carey said he'd donate $1 million if he gets 1 million followers by Dec. 31.
Olanoff never expected his auction to get attention from other Drews like Carey.
The L.A.-based blogger is also behind the @BlameDrew'sCancer username.
