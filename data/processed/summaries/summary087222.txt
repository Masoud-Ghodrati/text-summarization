2 astronauts did a spacewalk to address ammonia leaking from the International Space Station.
They inspected the site of the leak and replaced a pump controller box on the orbiter.
Afterward, initial tests showed no sign of a continuing leak, which was spotted Thursday,.
3 of the 6 men involved in the 5Â½-hour spacewalk are set to leave for Earth on Monday.
