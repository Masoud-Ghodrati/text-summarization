Authorities say a house holds a second homemade explosive, PETN.
PETN happens to be the target of new U.S. airport body scans and pat downs.
The 8 or 9 pounds of HMTD found is equivalent to a "large" car bomb, expert says.
Bomb technicians must be careful; the slightest friction could cause an explosion.
