Bede Sheppard: Malala shooting reminds that schools, globally, are besieged in war zones.
He says schools attacked in 25 nations in past 5 years, including Yemen, Thailand, India.
He says militias use them for fighting, they become targets; kids lose stability, education.
Sheppard: World must see this as war crime, put protections in place, even in war.
