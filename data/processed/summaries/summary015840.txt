On Tuesday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to make streets safer.
On Thursday, a New York TV station shot video of a trip by the mayor.
The video showed his two-car caravan apparently speeding and violating other traffic laws.
The NYPD says tactics are sometimes used when transporting any "protectee".
