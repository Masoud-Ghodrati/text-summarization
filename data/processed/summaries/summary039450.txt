Police say a 36-year-old man was laid off and returned to former workplace hours later.
He killed a UPS driver, the owner of Accent Signage Systems and three others, police say.
The small-business owner was honored in March at the White House, mayor says.
Police found the shooter, who his family says was mentally ill, dead of a self-inflicted wound.
