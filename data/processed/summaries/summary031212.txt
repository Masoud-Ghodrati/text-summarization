There are only 800 mountain gorillas, found across two habitats in central Africa.
The species is endangered, but their numbers are growing due to conservation efforts.
Rwanda's Karisoke Research Center was founded by the late zoologist Dian Fossey.
Her mission continues there, with some gorillas she named still under observation.
