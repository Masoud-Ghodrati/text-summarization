Thousands of Syrian refugees are living across the border in Lebanon.
Abdul-Rahman Al Akari says his wife, a mother of 3, was killed at an illegal crossing.
For thousands of Syrians, the decision to flee was a matter of life and death.
Some of the wounded in hospitals say they might risk a return to rejoin the revolution.
