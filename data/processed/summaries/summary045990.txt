Frida Ghitis says GOP candidates avow support for Israel more and more frequently.
She says they are not courting small Jewish vote as much as large pro-Israel vote.
She says if candidates really want to help Israel, they should back off inflammatory remarks.
Ghitis: Most Israelis back two-state solution; Gingrich's Palestinian comment hurts.
