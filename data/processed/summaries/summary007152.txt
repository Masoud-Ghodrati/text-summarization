Enrique Pena Nieto presidential victory in Mexico is a return to an old, once-corrupt party.
The PRI says it has changed even though its old tools of corruption remain.
As Pena Nieto is inaugurated many are asking: Is he a new man or just a new face?.
Success may be measured in his ability to tap Mexico's potential.
