Six Americans are accused of trying to smuggle weapons into Honduras on their ship.
The 2 handguns, 2 shotguns and a semiautomatic rifle seized are for defense, ship's captain says.
He says an appellate court will decide whether to throw out the case or hear arguments.
The Americans say they aim to split profits from log salvaging with a Honduran municipality.
