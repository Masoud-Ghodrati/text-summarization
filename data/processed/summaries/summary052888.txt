Elaine Swann: Obama "selfie" with Denmark PM at Mandela memorial looked inappropriate.
But photog said it was during celebratory part of service; first lady had been smiling, too.
She says selfie appropriate for Obama, given circumstances, but not usually OK at funerals.
Swann: In church, synagogue, at services, selfies not OK etiquette. Wait until afterward.
