CNN's Richard Quest is in Davis County, where in 1864 the Confederates made one of their most daring raids of the war.
He is in the U.S. as part of American Quest, a series on the election airing from October 29.
Quest stops in Iowa because it is a swing state which often votes for the election winner.
