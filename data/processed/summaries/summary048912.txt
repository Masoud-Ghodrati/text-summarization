Greg Bear: Asteroid Apophis flew by this month and was much larger than expected.
Named after an evil Egyptian serpent god, Apophis swings by every seven years.
Bear: We can never be 100% sure how close it will come or if events might change its course.
If Apophis hit Earth, he says, the blast would be the equivalent of over a billion tons of TNT.
