The British Racing School at Newmarket runs a fitness boot camp for jockeys.
Jockeys focus on core, legs and upper body strength but aim to avoid muscle mass.
Jockey Martin Lane trains six days a week and races every day in the summer.
Success in races depends 90% on horsepower and 10% on jockey ability.
