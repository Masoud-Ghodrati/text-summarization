Renoir painted "Paysage Bords De Seine" in 1879.
A Paris gallery bought the painting, and a collector later purchased it.
The painting was loaned to the Baltimore Museum of Art, which reported it stolen in 1951.
In 2010, a woman bought it at a flea market for $7; it's valued between $75,000 and $100,000.
