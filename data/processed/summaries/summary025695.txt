NEW: Dharun Ravi's lawyer says he was very cooperative with investigators.
Prosecutors say Ravi spied and intimidated his roommate, who later killed himself.
Ravi messaged his webcam would show the roommate's encounter with a man.
The defense notes Ravi texted the next day that the "viewing party" plan was "a joke".
