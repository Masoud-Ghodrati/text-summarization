A Penn State lawyer says CNN cannot have the police report tied to a 1998 probe.
That investigation related to Jerry Sandusky's alleged sexual misconduct with a boy.
It didn't lead to criminal charges, which is a reason info wasn't provided, the lawyer says.
Pennsylvania's "right-to-know" law doesn't apply to Penn State, even if it gets state funds.
