Al Qaeda's number two leader was killed in a CIA drone strike.
Peter Bergen says it shows that the terrorist organization is effectively out of business.
He says the only senior leader left is Ayman al-Zawahiri, the successor to bin Laden.
Bergen: Fearing present day al Qaeda is more irrational than fearing a lightning strike.
