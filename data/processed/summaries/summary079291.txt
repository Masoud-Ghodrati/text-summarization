An escaped inmate, Rodney Long, broke into a couple's home as they were sleeping.
He took the gun Jerome Mauderly had loaded to protect his home from the inmate.
Long roamed the house, and Mauderly recovered the gun as wife, Carolyn, called 911.
Mauderly then shot Long; he will not be charged in self-defense case.
