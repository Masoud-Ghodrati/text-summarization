NEW: A pro-Santorum PAC buys $310,000 in ad time in Illinois.
Santorum says that English should be required for Puerto Rico to become a state.
Romney's campaign responds with a statement saying he would not require that.
Puerto Rico, next on the campaign trail, has a statehood referendum in November.
