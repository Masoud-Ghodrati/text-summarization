Two Palestinian teenagers were killed in clashes with Israeli authorities in May.
Cameras showed one of the teens being killed and the suspected shooter.
Israeli border police officer has been arrested in one death; no charges have been filed.
A human rights advocate says such arrests of Israeli police are "incredibly rare".
