The space rock that blew up over Russia had been darkened by ancient crashes.
"Dark asteroids are harder to detect because they reflect less light," scientist says.
The meteor injured about 1,500 people when it crashed to Earth in February.
Scientists have found about 100 pieces, the biggest of which is about 11 pounds.
