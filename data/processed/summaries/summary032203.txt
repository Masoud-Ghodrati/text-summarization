The Marcus Autism Center's goal: Teach skills so kids can move into community.
Students at Marcus Center are grouped not by age, but by level of function.
Classes are small, with certified special education teacher plus several assistants.
Some children arrive with no "readiness" skills, like talking or putting on shoes.
