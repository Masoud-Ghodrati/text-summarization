CNN Exclusive: Egyptian blogger Aliaa Magda Elmahdy tells CNN why she posed naked.
Elmadhy says she posed naked because she is not afraid of being a woman despite harassment in Egypt.
She says her Muslim parents want to support her; her father always hated the way she dressed.
Elmadhy: I am a believer of every word I say and I am willing to live in danger under the many threats I receive.
