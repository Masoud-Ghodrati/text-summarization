Police interview co-workers and arrest baggage handler Dicarlo Bennett, 28.
He was "playing around" when he allegedly detonated a dry ice bomb, police say.
"He thought it was funny," police say, and "had no intent to attack innocent victims".
He works with Servisair, officials say; deputy police chief says he's jailed on $1 million bail.
