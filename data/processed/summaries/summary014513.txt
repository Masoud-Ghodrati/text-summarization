An anti-whaling group says it split up Japan's fleet and chased it out of the Antarctic zone.
"Within a day and a half, we have the entire whaling fleet in disarray," an activist says.
Japan says the whaling ships are still in the Southern Ocean and the hunt continues.
Environmental groups clash each year with Japan's whaling vessels.
