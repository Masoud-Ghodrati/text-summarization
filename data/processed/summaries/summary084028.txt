Veteran Spanish golfer Miguel Angel Jimenez faces long recovery after skiing accident.
The 48-year-old breaks his leg while on the slopes in Sierra Nevada mountains.
He is expected to be sidelined for at least three months after breaking tibia in right leg.
Jimenez became European Tour's oldest winner with victory in Hong Kong in December.
