Gulf oil spill threatens sacred burial ground of Louisiana's Point Aux Chenes Indian Tribe.
Most of the tribe's 700 members also rely on fishing and fear the spill could end their way of life.
Members say no federal or state officials have advised them on dealing with the disaster.
Native Americans from Alaska told the tribe how they dealt with the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill.
