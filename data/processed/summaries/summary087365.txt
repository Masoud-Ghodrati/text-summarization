A call between Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet and Catherine Ashton is leaked.
In the recording, Paet talks about his recent visit to Ukraine.
He says a doctor told him the opposition may have been behind deadly sniper fire.
Paet: "The fact that this phone call has been leaked is not a coincidence".
