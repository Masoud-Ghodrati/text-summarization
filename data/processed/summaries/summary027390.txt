New immigration law adds to tension in Arizona, says Ruben Navarrette Jr..
Illegal immigrants on edge even though judge blocked worse parts of law, he says.
Navarrette: Some have left Arizona in search of a better climate in other states.
Law is polarizing; whites support it strongly and Latinos opposing it, Navarrette says.
