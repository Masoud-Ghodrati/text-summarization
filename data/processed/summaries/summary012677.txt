LZ Granderson: "Diva" once applied to people with long records of achievement.
He says the term now is used for many who are famous for being famous or early in their careers.
LZ: True divas are people like Leontyne Price, Barbara Streisand, Meryl Streep.
Kanye West calling himself a "creative genius" rules him out of the diva category, LZ says.
