A "hung parliament" is when no party has the minimum number of seats to enjoy a governing majority.
The UK last saw a hung parliament in 1974, which saw two elections in the same year.
Many European countries regularly produce minority or coalition governments.
There has been agitation in some financial circles about the possibility of a hung parliament.
