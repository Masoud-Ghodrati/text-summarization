Ruben Navarrette: A columnist said the only thing the GOP has to offer Latinos is "chimichangas".
When Obama's campaign manager tweeted the line, the GOP complained.
Navarrette says the statement was wrong; Republicans do offer policies Hispanic voters like.
He says it's a bad idea to tell an ethnic group what you think they should value.
