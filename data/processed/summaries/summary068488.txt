Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso agrees a deal to buy the Spanish Euskaltel Euskadi cycling team.
The Formula One driver plans to start work building a new team for 2014.
Euskaltel did not have funding to continue racing next season.
The team was famous for only employing riders born in the Basque region of Spain.
