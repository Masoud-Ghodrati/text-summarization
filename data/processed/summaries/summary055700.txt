Two Iranian warships dock in Port Sudan, officials and witnesses say.
The visit is part of routine exercises by friendly nations, says Sudanese military spokesman.
The Iranian officers met with top Sudanese navy commanders, Iranian state media say.
Another pair of Iranian warships called into Port Sudan less than six weeks ago.
