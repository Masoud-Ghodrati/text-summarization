Hong Kong people tend to shun houses where the occupant met a violent death.
The apartments are known as "hongza" in Cantonese, meaning "calamity houses".
'"Hongza" apartments can sell at a steep discount, sometimes as much as 40%.
Buyers still trade in the apartments, which can show a strong yield on the rental market.
