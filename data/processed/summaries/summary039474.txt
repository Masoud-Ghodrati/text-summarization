Ruben Navarrette: Disney's newest princess, Sofia, may or may not be Hispanic.
Navarrette: Executive producer said Sofia is Hispanic, but Disney said she's just a princess.
He says a lot of Hispanics -- 52 million Americans -- don't like being played with.
Navarrette: Disney wants to dip into the Hispanic market but botched it with this attempt.
