ESA's Philae landing craft is due to touch down on a comet surface on November 12.
The mission may shed light on whether water may have been brought to Earth by comets.
Philae has been designed to grip like a limpet because the comet's gravity is so weak.
If successful, first pictures could come back about two hours after landing.
