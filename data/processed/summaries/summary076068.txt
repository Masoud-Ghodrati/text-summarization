Manila's fake degree mill does a thriving business on Claro M. Recto Avenue.
Known jokingly as 'Recto University', forgers can mock up a degree in a matter of hours.
Counterfeiters also fake all types of IDs including seamans' and pilots' licenses.
Manila authorities have launched several crackdowns but the illegal trade still flourishes.
