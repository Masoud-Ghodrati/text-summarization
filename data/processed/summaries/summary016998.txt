Five children in California have a "polio-like syndrome," according to neurologists.
Two of the children tested positive for enterovirus 68, a rare type of enterovirus.
Another type, enterovirus 71, is more commonly linked to paralysis.
Both are uncommon in the United States; state health officials say risk is very low.
