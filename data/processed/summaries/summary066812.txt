Bob Greene lunched with George McGovern after the senator's failed presidential bid.
He says McGovern wondered then whether his campaign had seemed doomed to reporters.
He says some called McGovern soft, but he was a valorous WW II combat pilot; also a good guy.
Greene: McGovern was surrounded by home, friendship when he died Sunday.
