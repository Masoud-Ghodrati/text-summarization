NEW: NOAA is hoping "nature will take its course," with the whale likely to die overnight.
"It's stuck in (water) five feet deep at most," firefighter says.
The whale is alive but looks injured, New York Police Department officer says.
"We are keeping it wet and dousing it with water to keep it breathing," he says.
