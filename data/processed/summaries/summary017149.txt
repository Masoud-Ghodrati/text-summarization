American Ted Ligety's four-race winning streak in the giant slalom comes to an end.
Ligety, starting first, didn't finish the first run Saturday in Val d'Isere.
The last time he missed out on a podium finish in the giant slalom was in 2012.
Lindsey Vonn elects to sit out this weekend's women's races in Switzerland.
