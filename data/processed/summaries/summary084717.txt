NEW: North Korea fully reopens its border to South Koreans without explanation.
Pyongyang closed border March 9 because of U.S.-S. Korea military exercises.
Border partly opened Monday, allowing 300 South Koreans allowed to go home.
Stranded S. Koreans mostly work at joint industrial complex in border town Kaesong.
