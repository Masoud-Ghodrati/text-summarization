A saber-toothed whale from the Alaskan deep sea washes ashore in Los Angeles.
Its carcass is intact, giving tourists at Venice Beach and scientists a rare sighting.
Earlier this week, a rare oarfish that was 18 feet long is found at a coastal island.
Scientists can't say whether the rare animals' strandings are because of global warming.
