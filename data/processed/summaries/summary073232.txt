LZ Granderson: Many expect Mitt Romney to pick a "safe" conservative running mate.
He says Romney doesn't need to rally the support of base that already opposes Obama.
A smarter move would be for Romney to choose Michael Bloomberg, Granderson says.
Granderson: Bloomberg pick would gain independent support, help show seriousness.
