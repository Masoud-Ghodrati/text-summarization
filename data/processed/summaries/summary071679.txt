Suspect, Jose Angel Arregui Erana, arrested in August 2009.
He doesn't appear to have been a priest, but a teacher in a Catholic order's schools.
Arregui held on suspicion of filming abuse, possessing images of sexually abused boys.
Authorities say none of the alleged victims have been willing to go public.
