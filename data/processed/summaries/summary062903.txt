Stewart Verdery: GOP should resist temptation to just blast Obama's immigration move.
He says the President has discretion to change the way deportation decisions are made.
GOP should oppose Obama granting work permits but should pass smart reforms, he says.
Verdery: Blocking immigration reform of any kind will be an albatross for GOP in 2016.
