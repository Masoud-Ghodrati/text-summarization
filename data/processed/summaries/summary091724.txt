Residents of Liege say they are shocked by the attack and fear for their children's safety.
The motivation of attacker Nourdine Amrani, 33, is not known, police say.
Neighbors say they saw little of the suspect, who lived in Liege.
Amrani, previously convicted of arms offenses, was known to a local gun store owner.
