City special commissioner Vittorio Zappalorto says rules on noise restriction have been misinterpreted.
He says a maximum 500 euro fine will not apply to wheeled luggage being used in the city.
Zappalorto says he hopes the furore will nevertheless encourage the tourism to address noisy baggage issue.
