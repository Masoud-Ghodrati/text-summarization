Ruben Navarrette: GOP plan to float new version of DREAM Act a step in right direction.
He says plan would let kids who are undocumented be legal but not citizens if in college, military.
He says Dems don't like this, as they want to claim DREAM Act and loyalty of Latinos.
Navarrette: Some Dems faltered on pushing issue through; time to give new plan a chance.
