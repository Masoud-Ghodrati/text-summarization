NEW: Teen told he will wait about 3 to 4 months for a new heart, family friend says.
A 15-year-old in Georgia initially told he couldn't be on heart transplant list.
His family learned this week he's being put on the transplant list.
Original hospital letter to family said teen denied due to "history of noncompliance".
