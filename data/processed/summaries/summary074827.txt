FEMA disbursed more than $7 billion in aid after hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit in 2005.
Later, FEMA estimated that about $643 million were improper payments.
FEMA cited human error and fraud as the causes of improper payments.
An inspector says FEMA "has not given final approval" on a process to recoup the money.
