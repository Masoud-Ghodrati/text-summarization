Roland Martin: John Sununu said Colin Powell backed Obama because he is black.
He says it's asinine to say race motivates blacks' endorsements rather than accomplishment.
He wants Sununu to explain how Romney's whiteness earned his support.
Martin: It's childish for some whites to reduce black support to skin color, not character.
