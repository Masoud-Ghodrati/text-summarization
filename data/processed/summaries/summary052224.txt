Bosnian Muslim woman was raped daily while held by Serb soldiers during war.
Jasmina says she begged for late-term abortion of attacker's baby after she escaped.
Still traumatized, she says she never wants to return to her former home city.
But Bosnian government policy may send her back there, she fears.
