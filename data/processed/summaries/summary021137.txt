NEW: Scientists give first 'go-ahead' for an attempted landing on Comet 67P.
The landing craft Philae is about the size of a domestic washing machine.
It is equipped with nine experiments including a drill to sample the surface and test in an on-board oven.
The comet's gravity is so weak that engineers have come up with ingenious solutions to keep Philae in place.
