A federal judge dismissed a suit challenging broad NYPD surveillance of Muslims.
Arjun Sethi says the ruling breaches privacy, sustains fear among many Muslims.
He says the judge erred in blaming journalists rather than police for the harm caused.
Sethi: The targeting of Muslims will be seen as a tragic infringement of civil liberties.
