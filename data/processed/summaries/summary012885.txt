NEW: Frank Kameny died peacefully of natural causes, his sister says.
Kameny, who served in WWII, fought against the Army's policy of discharging homosexuals.
He urged what was then called the homophile movement to assert itself to achieve equality.
He worked to end homoexuality's classification as a mental illness.
