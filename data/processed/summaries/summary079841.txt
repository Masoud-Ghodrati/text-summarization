A 190,000-pound truck pump is now in South Carolina, being prepped to fly out of Atlanta.
It had been at a mixed oxide fuel plant site in southeast Georgia.
A contractor says the truck's first priority will be to supply water to keep nuclear fuel cool.
Similar pumps were used in Chernobyl, which was eventually encased in concrete.
