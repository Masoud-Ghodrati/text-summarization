Jay Parini: Vermont a haven of mountains, red barns, clapboard houses, covered bridges.
Bad weather comes in winter, he says, with ice bending trees and snow blocking roads.
Now, Brattleboro deep under water, ruined covered bridges and homes, Parini says.
Parini: Vermonters left to clean up in the calm, bright weather Irene left behind.
