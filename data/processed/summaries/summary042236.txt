Ayman al-Zawahiri appears on a video posted on jihadist forums, an intelligence group says.
The al Qaeda leader urges Saudis to rise up against the country's rulers.
al-Zawahiri says the rulers are criminals for opening the country to U.S. troops.
The video statement was posted online, the SITE Intelligence Group says.
