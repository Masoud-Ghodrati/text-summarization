Todd Graham: Obama revived himself and gave a stellar (but not perfect) debate performance.
He says Obama used "primacy effect" technique to be most persuasive first thing in debate.
He says Obama also used Romney's own words against him, a timeless, winning strategy.
Graham: Romney used that technique too, but late in debate; lost valuable time in waiting.
