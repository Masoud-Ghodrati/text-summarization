Terrorist group ISIS controls some oil fields in North Iraq, which helps fund its activities.
The group is using smuggling routes to get crude into nearby countries, and refine it.
The refined oil is then sold locally and used to fund ISIS' warfare and raise money.
The impact on global markets has so far been limited as ISIS is not in southern Iraq.
