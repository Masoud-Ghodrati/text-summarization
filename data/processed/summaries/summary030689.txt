Two women shot during the search for Christopher Dorner "not doing well," attorney says.
They were driving a truck similar to one police said Dorner was driving during vendetta.
Los Angeles will pay them $40,000 for the loss of the truck, city attorney says.
The two sides will discuss personal injury compensation next.
