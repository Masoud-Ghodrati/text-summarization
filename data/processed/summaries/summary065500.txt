Wesley Clark: U.S. must respond to ISIS threat, but with coordinated regional response.
He says U.S. can support Islamic friends in region threatened by ISIS, but can't fight their war.
He says ISIS has sights on states like Jordan, Lebanon; it could well seize Saudi Arabia.
Clark: U.S. involvement only helps recruit jihadists. Mideast nations facing their moment of truth.
