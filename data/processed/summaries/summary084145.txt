Device is called Aakash, which means "sky" in Hindi, and costs 2,276 rupees.
Aakash isn't for sale yet; it's for students without library access, official says.
It's assembled in India but isn't completely made there; parts come from other nations.
Education Ministry admits device has its limits, wants student feedback.
