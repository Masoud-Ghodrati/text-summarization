A Quinnipiac University poll showed Sen. Udall trailing Rep. Cory Gardner 40-48%.
A USA Today/Suffolk University poll gave Gardner a 1-point edge.
The two nonpartisan polls are the first time Udall has been behind his opponent since July.
Udall's campaign manager dismissed his candidate's fall in this week's polls.
