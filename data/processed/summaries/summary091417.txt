Human Rights Watch says at least 65 prisoners have been executed in 40 days.
HRW official: Government "seems to have given state executioners the green light".
Iraq's Ministry of Justice calls it "fair punishment against terrorists and murderers".
HRW: Many defendants in Iraqi courts are "unable to pursue a meaningful defense".
