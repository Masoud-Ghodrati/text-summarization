Evan Thomas was asked, "what is it about testosterone that gets us into war?".
He says women brave, prudent; historically, men, like Teddy Roosevelt, eager for combat.
Women can make war (Thatcher, Meir) but lack men's macho urge to test themselves.
Thomas: Women tend to have have less need to show off.
