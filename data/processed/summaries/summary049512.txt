French authorities investigate a reported sighting of Luka Rocco Magnotta.
Police say Magnotta killed and dismembered a Chinese student, then mailed body parts.
He caused "Stephen Harper and (lawmakers) to reasonably fear for their safety," it says.
A warrant notes that police want him arrested on 5 charges, including murder.
