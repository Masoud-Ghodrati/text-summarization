The leader of an an Qaeda-linked group tells Syrian rebels to stop infighting.
More than 270 people are killed in four days of fighting between two rebel groups.
If infighting goes on, "The whole battlefield ... will pay the price," says al Nusra Front leader.
"The (Syrian) regime will rebound after it was near disappearing," he warns.
