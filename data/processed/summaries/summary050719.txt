Debaltseve, a small town in eastern Ukraine, has been a focus for violence.
One Ukrainian soldier leaving the area called it "a one-way street to the grave".
It is a crucial rail hub for rebel-held areas, connecting Luhansk and Donetsk.
Fighting has devastated the area and the civilians who are left are living underground.
