Dan Jones: Royal births in past were world news events, as they were key to world politics.
He asks: Why, when Windsors have so little sway now, does a birth still captivate world?.
He says Brits care: royal family a link to nation's history; Americans' interest less clear.
Jones: Monarchy like reality show; a tie to old class system. Brits jazzed that world cares.
