Netanyahu: Abbas "can't have it both ways" while embracing Hamas.
In 1983, Abbas called the death of 6 million Jews a "Zionist fantasy" and "fantastic lie".
Abbas now calls the Holocaust an embodiment of racism, calls on the world to fight injustice.
Abbas' Fatah faction said last week it will seek unity government with Hamas.
