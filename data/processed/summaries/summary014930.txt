Bob Greene: J. C. Penney is in trouble; could James Dean be the answer?.
He says urban legend was that Dean wore Penney's plain, white Towncraft T-shirt.
He says Penney should use that; adopt Dean as face of its brand, win back customers.
Greene: Penney's, a stalwart of American retail, could break from pack with Dean's help.
