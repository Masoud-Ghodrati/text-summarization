Father of a dead Marine was ordered to pay court costs to protesters who picketed funeral.
John Ellsworth, whose son also died in the Marines, says ruling was unconscionable.
He says soldiers and families make great sacrifices to protect the nation.
Ellsworth urges the U.S. Supreme Court to restore justice and dignity to the family.
