Zakieya L. Avery, 28, and Monifa Sanford, 21, have been ordered to undergo evaluations.
Both women have been charged with two counts of first-degree murder.
Avery allegedly led a group called "Demon Assassins," authorities say.
The purpose of the group "was to get rid of the devil, the evil spirits," police say.
