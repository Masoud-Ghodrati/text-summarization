Police in Mexico find a cannon attached to a compressor on an abandoned pickup truck.
Cannon was apparently used to fire bags of drugs over the border, authorities say.
In a separate incident last year, U.S. agents found cans of marijuana plopped in an Arizona field.
Cannon is believed to have been involved in that incident, too, U.S. agent says.
