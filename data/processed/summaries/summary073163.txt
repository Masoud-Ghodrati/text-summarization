The anti-abortion group Live Action secretly taped a video at a Planned Parenthood facility.
The group sent a man and a woman posing as a sex-trafficking pimp and a prostitute.
A Planned Parenthood employee purportedly advised them on abortions for underage girls.
Planned Parenthood says the employee has been fired.
