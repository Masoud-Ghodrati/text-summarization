Two-time Masters winner Bubba Watson gets in the festive spirit with a Christmas music video.
In it, he appears rapping as the self-styled character Bubbaclaus in a Santa costume.
He drives around on a hovercraft golf buggy as well as a miniature tractor.
This is his third major musical venture having previously appeared with The Golf Boys.
