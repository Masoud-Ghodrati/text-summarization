Traveling for the holidays means no one person or family member has to care for everyone else.
Resorts and ships take care of the decor, the meals and the changing of the sheets.
Activities can provide an escape from relatives asking about marriage, children and weight.
Santa Claus may have to deliver a lighter load to a traveling child.
