Israel's national lottery produced same six double-digit numbers in less than a month.
Officials feared problems after the same numbers came up a second time.
But after finding nothing amiss results of the second drawing were certified.
Three win more than $1 million each from second drawing of 36, 33, 32, 26, 14, 13.
