Mohamed Al Fayed sells soccer's Fulham to billionaire N.F.L. owner Shahid Khan.
Although the selling price wasn't revealed, reports suggest it was around $230 million.
The Cottagers cemented their place in England's top division under Al Fayed.
Khan moved to the U.S. at the age of 16 and turned himself into one of the world's richest men.
