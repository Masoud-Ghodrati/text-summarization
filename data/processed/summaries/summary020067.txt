Couples in Swaziland are being urged to get the HIV 'love test' together.
Tests can be useless if partners are not aware of the others' HIV status.
Only one in four know their HIV status and 26 percent in Swaziland are HIV positive.
The charity wanted to avoid the traditional fear mongering that surrounds HIV testing.
