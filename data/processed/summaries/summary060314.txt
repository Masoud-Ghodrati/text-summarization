The National Weather Service forecasts 40-to-50 foot waves for Oahu.
But a big wave surf contest has been postponed because of bad wind conditions.
"The size is there, but the quality is not," an event organizer says.
The organizers will keep waiting until the end of February for "one day of quality surf".
