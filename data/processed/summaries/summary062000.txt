NEW: Top U.S. diplomat calls opposition's vote to attend conference "courageous".
Representatives of the country's main opposition group vote 58 to 14 in favor of attending.
The goal of the talks is to set up a transitional government to end the violence.
Syria has proposed a negotiated "end to military operations" in Aleppo, perhaps elsewhere.
