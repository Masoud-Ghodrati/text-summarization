Laurent Blanc choses not to select any of France's 23-man World Cup squad for Norway friendly.
Blanc makes the decision following the squad's boycott of training during the World Cup.
Franck Ribery, Eric Abidal, Nicolas Anelka and Florent Malouda among those suspended.
Captain Patrice Evra was involved in a row with a fitness coach which prompted boycott.
