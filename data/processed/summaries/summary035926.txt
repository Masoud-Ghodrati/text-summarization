A coalition operation against militants leaves at least 50 insurgents dead.
The encampment was considered a staging ground for Haqqani and foreign fighters.
The Haqqani network is an insurgent group loosely affiliated with the Taliban.
They are believed to be based in Pakistan's lawless frontier territories.
