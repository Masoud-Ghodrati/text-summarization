Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has taken over Iraq's second largest city, Mosul.
Charlie Cooper of anti-extremism think tank Quilliam says development is worrying.
"Rejected by al Qaeda because of its ferocity," ISIS "has a fetish for anti-Shia sectarianism".
International community -- and Iraq -- must act against ISIS's gains, says Cooper.
