James Kindall: War veterans have tales, sometimes harrowing; many can't tell them.
Others can't understand, he says; it was like this with his father, who served in WW II.
He says sometimes, though, he'd share stories of friends killed, of nearly losing leg.
Kindall: Dad didn't enjoy Veterans Day. When parade passed, he only saw friends lost.
