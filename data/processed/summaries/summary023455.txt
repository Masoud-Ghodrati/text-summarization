Disgraced "deaf composer" Mamoru Samuragochi has admitted he has some hearing.
Composer hailed as the "Japanese Beethoven" for writing hit symphonies despite deafness.
A Tokyo music teacher revealed he had been the ghostwriter of the music for 18 years.
He said he did not believe Samuragochi was deaf, or could write scores at all.
