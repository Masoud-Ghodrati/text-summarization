NEW: The United States calls on both sides to honor the cease-fire agreement.
Cease-fire begins Tuesday at 8 a.m. local time, an Israeli spokesman says.
"We will cease all our activities," an Israeli government spokesman says.
The operation to destroy Hamas' tunnels "is winding up," the spokesman says.
