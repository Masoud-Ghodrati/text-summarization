NEW: "Impossible" to think Picasso gave works away, a family representative says.
A 71-year-old retired electrician sought to have 271 unknown works authenticated.
The Picasso family is suing the man, alleging that the works are stolen.
The lawsuit, filed in September, was reported by a French newspaper Monday.
