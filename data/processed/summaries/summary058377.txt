Lawyer: UK government evidence suggests Russia tied to ex-KGB agent's death.
Alexander Litvinenko worked for MI6 and Spanish intelligence services, widow's lawyer says.
Litvinenko died after being poisoned by radioactive material polonium-210 in 2006.
Litvinenko on deathbed blamed Russia's Vladimir Putin, but the Kremlin denies the accusation.
