The FAA says Horizon Air operated 22 aircraft with improper rivets.
The airline made 186,189 flights while the planes were "unairworthy," the FAA says.
The agency is proposing a $1 million civil penalty against the regional carrier.
Horizon Air says it believed the rivets were OK, "at no time was passenger safety compromised".
