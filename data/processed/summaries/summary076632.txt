Bryce Reed is sentenced to 21 months in federal prison, a prosecutor's office says.
He had pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess an unregistered destructive device.
Reed was among the first responders to a deadly blast at a Texas fertilizer plant.
His lawyers have said the charges are unrelated to that incident, which left 15 dead.
