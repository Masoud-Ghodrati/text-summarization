Los Angeles school officials submit 604 teacher discipline cases for state licensing review.
State teaching licensing authorities say they will investigate 366 of the teachers.
The action is fallout from a teacher misconduct scandal in the school system.
"The safety of our students is our No. 1 priority," L.A. school official says.
