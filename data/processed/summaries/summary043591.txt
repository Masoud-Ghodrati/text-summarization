Rodriguez says MLB and Commissioner Selig "engaged in tortious and egregious conduct".
He says they have ignored "baseball's collectively bargained labor agreements".
MLB, in response, says the suit is an attempt "to circumvent the collective bargaining agreement".
Rodriguez was handed a suspension much longer than 13 others in the Biogenesis probe.
