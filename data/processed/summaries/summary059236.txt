More than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped in Nigeria on April 14 are still missing.
The mass abduction has been claimed by militant Islamist group Boko Haram.
The United States is among the countries that have offered to help Nigeria find the girls.
Tolu Ogunlesi says Nigerians realize foreign help is needed but query U.S. motives.
