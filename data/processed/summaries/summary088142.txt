The Gullah/Geechee is a group of people based in the North Carolina-Georgia seaboard.
Their descendants came from West Africa, brought to America as slaves around the 1700s.
The Gullah/Geechee are trying to hold onto the way of life of their African ancestors.
They pass on their traditions from one generation to the next.
