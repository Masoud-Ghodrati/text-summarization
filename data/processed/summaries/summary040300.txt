Katie Couric says she'll interview Manti T'eo and his parents for her talk show.
The interview -- Te'o's first on camera in recent days -- will air Thursday, she says.
Te'o has said he was duped in the creation of a girlfriend he met online but wasn't real.
Uncle defends nephew accused in the hoax, saying, "It takes two to tango".
