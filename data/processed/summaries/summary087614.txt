Josh Fryday, a friend of Elizabeth Edwards, said goodbye a few months ago.
Elizabeth visited Japan to show her children where she spent much of her childhood.
She said she feared most what would happen to her children without a mother.
She believed it isn't how many years we have, but how many good years.
