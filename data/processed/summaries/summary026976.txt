David Frum: Newt Gingrich has attracted some ridicule for his plan for a moon colony.
He says Gingrich isn't alone in proposing to spend money on unnecessary manned mission.
Frum says science can be done more effectively, cheaply in space with unmanned missions.
He says Gingrich's idea isn't a plan for the future, but rather nostalgia.
