Nigeria footballer Stephen Worgu could receive 40 lashes after he was convicted of drinking alcohol in Sudan.
Alcohol is illegal in the Muslim north of Sudan according to Article 78 of the country's penal code.
The lawyer for the Al-Merreikh forward has appealed against the punishment handed out to Worgu.
