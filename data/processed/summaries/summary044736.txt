There's an operation guarding WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.
London Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe says the operation is being reviewed, as there's "no doubt it's a drain".
Assange has been in the embassy since June 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden to answer to sex assault claims.
