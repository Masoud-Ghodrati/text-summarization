Killing of former Afghan President, Burhanuddin Rabbani, dealt a blow to peace advocates.
Rabbani was also the Chairman of President Hamid Karzai's High Council for Peace.
Some analysts say this was an attempt to eliminate one of the few credible, ethnic opposition leaders.
Tajiks and other minorities will never now accept a government dominated by majority Pashtuns.
