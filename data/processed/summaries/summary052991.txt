Is President Obama's team exploiting Osama bin Laden's death for political purposes?.
David Gergen says the answer is yes, but other presidents have done similar things.
He says the real question is whether the world is safer after bin Laden is gone.
Gergen: Other militant Islamists are active; Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is worrisome.
