A tribunal has begun prosecution of crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge regime.
Sophal Ear says his mother, who fled Cambodia, believed killers would pay for their crime.
She and her children were able to escape from Cambodia by posing as Vietnamese.
Ear's mother worked hard in France, U.S., to make sure her children got a good education.
