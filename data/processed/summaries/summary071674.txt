Seattle police give away 1,000 bags of Doritos with advice about smoking pot on them.
"Don't drive while high" and "Don't use pot in public," the bags read.
"We knew if we did leaflets, it would turn into litter," one sergeant says.
The cops ran out of Doritos in less than 30 minutes at Seattle's Hempfest.
