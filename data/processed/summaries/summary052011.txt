"I've been hiding a show injury and chronic pain for sometime now," Lady Gaga says.
Gaga suffers from synovitis, a severe inflammation of joints, her tweets say.
"After last nights performance I could not walk and still can't," she tweeted.
Chicago, Detroit and Hamilton, Ontario, shows are postponed.
