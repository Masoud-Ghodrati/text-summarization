A company has developed technology that cools truck cabs without engine idling.
Called BlueCool, the system combines refrigerant and a water/glycol mixture.
BlueCool doesn't have any emissions or use any fuel, spokesman says.
Some 7 percent of U.S. daily oil consumption is attributed to heavy-duty truck idling.
