FA upholds Wayne Rooney's two-match ban for swearing in front of a TV camera.
The ban means Rooney will miss Man Utd's FA Cup semifinal against Man City on April 16.
The England striker and Man Utd both expressed disappointment in the FA's verdict.
Rooney will be eligible to play in the Champions League second leg against Chelsea on Tuesday.
