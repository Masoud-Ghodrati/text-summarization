A Harvard sophomore is accused of sending phony e-mail threats to avoid final exam.
Eldo Kim, 20, allegedly e-mailed the threats half an hour before his exam was to begin.
His exam and others were canceled for the day after buildings were evacuated.
Kim's first court appearance is slated for Wednesday.
