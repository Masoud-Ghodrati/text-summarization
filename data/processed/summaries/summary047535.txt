Liverpool's Luis Suarez will not appeal 10-match ban for biting Branislav Ivanovic.
The incident occurred during last Sunday's 2-2 drew between the two teams at Anfield.
Suarez was given a seven-match ban for biting while playing for Ajax in 2010.
British Prime Minister David Cameron had called for tough action.
