Stephen Malone's carriage business goes back to his dad, who came from Ireland.
He says carriage rides are iconic New York; tourists come from all over to enjoy a ride.
Malone: Horses are treated very well; stables are open to inspection 365 days a year.
Malone: It is a thriving, well-regulated industry that can't be replaced with antique cars.
