Texas Gov. Rick Perry has been indicted on accusations he abused his power.
Charges stem from his threat to cut program run by a local DA unless she resigned.
Both Perry and the DA got mug shots -- hers for drunk driving charge.
But while she's back at work, he has to defend himself against felony charges.
