William Lynch was accused of confronting retired priest Jerold Lindner in 2010.
Lynch and his younger brother had claimed they were abused by Lindner decades earlier.
A civil suit by the brothers against Lindner led to a $625,000 settlement in 1998.
A jury Thursday acquitted Lynch on three counts, with a fourth dismissed after a deadlock.
