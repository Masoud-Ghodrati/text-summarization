Haiyang Zhu pleads guilty to first-degree murder in the death of Xin Yang.
Xin was attacked with a knife and decapitated at a restaurant in January.
They were believed to have known each other, but there was no sign of an argument.
Slaying was the first on the Virginia Tech campus since the 2007 shootings.
