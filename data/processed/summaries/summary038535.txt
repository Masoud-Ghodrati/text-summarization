A Democratic National Committee aide says the fact Bernie Sanders isn't a registered Democrat might not be a presidential problem for him.
The party defines "bona fide Democrats" as someone "whose record of public service, accomplishment, public writings" comport with the party.
Sanders has been an independent since the 1980s, but has caucused with the Democrats since coming to Congress in 1991.
