British-born terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, or "White Widow," has eluded Kenyan police.
Landlord of "White Widow" says Lewthwaite "changed her phone number" several times a day.
Lewthwaite was married to one of the bombers who attacked London in 2005.
Authorities say Lewthwaite became part of a terror cell linked to the Somali group Al-Shabaab.
