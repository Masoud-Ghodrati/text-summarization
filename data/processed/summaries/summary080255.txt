Bob Greene says a favorite kindergarten teacher died; her service is Wednesday.
He says the teacher, Miss Barbara, was much beloved and bound to her Ohio town.
He says she remembered names, was a touchstone for many; later was crossing guard.
Greene: In a fragmented world of fleeting relationships, Miss Barbara mattered.
