Japanese composer Mamoru Samuragochi says another person wrote his music.
Known as the "Japanese Beethoven," he has reportedly been deaf for 15 years.
The man who claims to have written the works says he does not believe Samuragochi is deaf.
But the composer's lawyers say he has a government-issued certificate confirming his hearing impairment.
