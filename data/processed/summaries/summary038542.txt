NEW: A neighbor of the victims says she is "horrified" by the killings.
The bodies of a young boy and his mother were found in the city of Brockton.
The district attorney asks, "Who would do that to a 2-year-old child?".
No one is in custody, no one has been named as a suspect in the pair's deaths.
