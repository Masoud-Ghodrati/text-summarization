Astronomers find a young, low-mass planet wandering through space alone.
"We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this," one says.
The planet will give an insight into the workings of young gas-giant planets like Jupiter.
It is easier to observe than other similar planets because it is not orbiting a young star.
