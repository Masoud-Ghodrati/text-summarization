An appeals court says Christian Louboutin can enforce its red-lacquered sole trademark.
But the trademark applies only if the sole color contrasts with the color of the rest of the shoe.
The trademark does not apply to monochromatic shoes, such as designs by Yves St. Laurent.
A lawsuit that Louboutin filed in June 2011 took issue with four specific YSL shoes.
