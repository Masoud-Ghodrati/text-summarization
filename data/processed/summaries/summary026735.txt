Mexican authorities found nearly 500 children living in squalor at a refuge in Michoacan state.
The children were subjected to physical, psychological and sexual abuse, authorities say.
The operator of the shelter was detained along with eight of her employees.
Michoacan governor Salvador Jara Guerrero: "We must not allow these things to occur".
