High Administrative Court says Egypt's parliament remains dissolved, as it ruled earlier.
But the court will rule October 15 on a similar case, leaving the door open for change.
Egypt's then-military rulers dissolved parliament after the court found vote unconstitutional.
President Morsy was critical and called parliament back, then said he'd respect court decision.
