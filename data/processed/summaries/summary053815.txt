Scientists are set to meet in Germany to discuss ways of tackling space debris.
It is estimated that there are 6,000 tons of space junk in Earth's orbit.
Space technology company Astrium has devised a plan to harpoon debris.
The debris would then be towed towards Earth's atmosphere, where it would burn up.
