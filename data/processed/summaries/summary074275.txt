At least 30 militants are killed in an airstrike on an Al-Shabaab training camp, Kenya's military says.
Among those killed are "key commanders," Kenyan military says.
The raid targeted the camp in the western Gedo region as militants were meeting, the military says.
Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, was behind a deadly attack on a Kenyan mall last year.
