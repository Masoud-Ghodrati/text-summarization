NEW: Thousands would have been spared but for Charles Taylor's role, prosecutor says.
The former Liberian president was convicted last week of war crimes charges.
There is no death penalty in the case; Taylor would serve time in a British prison.
Taylor aided fighters in a civil war in neighboring Sierra Leone.
