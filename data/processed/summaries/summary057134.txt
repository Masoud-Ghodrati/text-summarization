Marty Linsky: Mitt Romney drew attention to 2008 expectations for President Obama.
Inevitably, he says, Obama couldn't meet the high expectations his followers had.
Romney in 2012 and Obama in 2008 pandered to their audiences to gain votes, he says.
Linsky: Pandering is how you get elected; leadership is about what you do in office.
