Brett Ratner has resigned as producer of the 84th annual Academy Awards show.
In a statement Tuesday, Ratner says he apologizes "publicly and unreservedly".
Ratner made a demeaning remark during a Q&A session about his movie "Tower Heist".
"Rehearsing is for f*gs," New York Magazine's Vulture Blog quoted Ratner as saying.
