The World Health Organization declares Senegal free from Ebola.
The country had only one case, an infected man who entered by road from Guinea.
He recovered and 42 days have now passed without another case emerging, WHO says.
"An immediate, broad-based, and well-coordinated response can stop the Ebola virus," it says.
