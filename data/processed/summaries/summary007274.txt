China's government is sponsoring the Confucius Classroom program.
It sends teachers and money to U.S. schools to teach Chinese language and culture.
A suburban Ohio classroom is set to receive $30,000 from China to help fund the program.
A Los Angeles-area school district rejected the program after opposition.
