John Avlon: A new take on politics and realism in this year's Oscar crop. Call it "Poliwood".
He says in "Argo," "Zero Dark Thirty," "Lincoln," films show nuance, humanity in characters.
Day-Lewis, Avlon says particularly, shows Lincoln as a flawed political animal.
Avlon: You don't need to be perfect to be a hero. Authenticity can add to heroism.
