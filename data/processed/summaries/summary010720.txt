Dr. Kent Brantly went to West Africa to work for a Christian relief organization.
He recalls feeling "a little off" on July 23, then testing positive for Ebola virus.
Brantly says he had "no reserve," didn't know if he could continue breathing.
He did and -- after time at an Atlanta hospital -- was declared symptom-free.
