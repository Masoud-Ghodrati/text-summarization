Jerrilynn Dodds says siting a new mosque in lower Manhattan continues long New York tradition.
Muslims have prayed in city for most of its history, she says, likely starting with  slaves.
The number of mosques swelled in 1960s after immigration law passed; there are more than 100.
Dodds: Built by big architectural firms or community efforts, they reflect U.S. freedoms.
