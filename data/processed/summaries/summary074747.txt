Mbalax, combining jazz, soul, and rock with traditional beats, is the dance music of Senegal.
The godfather of the scene is the 82-year-old drummer Doudou N'Diaye Rose.
His instrument is the sabar, the traditional drum played with the hand and a stick.
Younger generations are fusing the sound with new influences to reach international audiences.
