Rudy Eugene, 31, was killed by police after he chewed off the face of a homeless man.
His body contained marijuana but no other drugs, the coroner's office says.
Police had suspected Eugene was under the influence of "bath salts".
The absence of "bath salts" is also confirmed by an outside lab, coroner says.
