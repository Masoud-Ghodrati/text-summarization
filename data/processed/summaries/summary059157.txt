Leap Motion controller lets you manipulate computer apps with hand gestures.
Using motion sensors, the controller detects your hand movements 2 feet away.
Navigating with Leap takes practice as the device can be maddeningly sensitive.
The controller costs $80 and will be available at Best Buy starting July 28.
