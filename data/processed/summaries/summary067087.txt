The U.S. Grand Prix of 2005 was one of the bizarre races in Formula One history.
14 cars sat out the race, with only Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi taking to the track.
Teams racing on Michelin branded tires elected to not take part in the race.
Formula One returns to the U.S. in Austin, Texas on November 18.
