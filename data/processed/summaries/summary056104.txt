On Tuesday's "Oprah Winfrey Show," Nadya Suleman revealed what her life is like.
She said the media has both invaded her privacy and been a way to make money.
She said she never thought she would have 8 more kids, and doing so was a selfish choice.
Suleman said she's determined to take care of her family on her own.
