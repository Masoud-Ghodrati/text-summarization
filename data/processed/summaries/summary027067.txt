Popular Party politician Isabel Carrasco, 59, was shot and killed Monday in Leon.
Officials say a mother and her daughter were arrested soon after the shooting.
Suspected motive is revenge; the daughter had been fired and had pay disputes, officials say.
Tests on the hands of the two suspects have not revealed who may have fired the weapon.
