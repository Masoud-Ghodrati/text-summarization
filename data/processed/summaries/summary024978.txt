Formula One's Monaco Grand Prix is a heady mix of racing and wealth.
Former team owner Flavio Briatore presides over Monte Carlo's Billionaire Club.
The club hosted an after party following Nico Rosberg's victory in Sunday's race.
Many racegoers prefer to take a beer onto the famous track once the race has finished.
