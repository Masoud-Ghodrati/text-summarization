John Seffrin: Court decision on health reform must be viewed in terms of impact on the sick.
He says millions with chronic diseases like cancer benefit from Affordable Care Act.
He says if court rules against it, they will return to days of coverage denial, high costs.
Seffrin: Act keeps insurance companies honest, young people covered. It's not about politics.
