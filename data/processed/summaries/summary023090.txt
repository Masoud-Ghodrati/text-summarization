Vibrio vulnificus is a naturally occurring bacterium that lives in warm saltwater.
Infected high-risk groups can experience blistering skin lesions, blood infections, death.
Although rare, infections need immediate medical attention if symptoms present.
Cook shellfish properly and avoid going into saltwater with wounds.
