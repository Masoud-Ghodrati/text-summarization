Harvey Weinstein says he won't back "crazy action (movies) to blow up ... and exploit people".
He says it's hypocritical to push for gun control while producing some violent films.
"Pulp Fiction," "Gangs of New York," "Django Unchained" were all produced by Weinstein.
Weinstein speaks days after announcing that he's behind a movie critical of the NRA.
