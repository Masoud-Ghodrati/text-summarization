Bob Greene: Patriotic songs sung at inauguration won't include "Hail to the Chief".
That song is usually played, not sung. The lyrics might not fly in the political moment, he says.
Imagine Boehner joining in to "Hail to the Chief, as we pledge cooperation...," he says.
Greene: Song has come and gone for presidential entrances; words remain unsung.
