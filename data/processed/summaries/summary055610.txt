A new Spider-Man debuts Wednesday with Ultimate Comics Fallout #4.
Peter Parker, the original alter ego of Spider-Man, "died" in Marvel Comics' Ultimate Universe.
The new Spider-Man is a half-African-American, half-Latino teenager.
The character "represents the diversity ... of the 21st century," the editor says.
