Police report: Jennifer Capriati had a run-in with an ex-boyfriend at a Florida gym.
Police say he accuses her of repeatedly punching him and having stalked him previously.
Capriati's camp calls his account an "overexaggeration," says she'll be vindicated.
Inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012, Capriati won three Grand Slam titles.
