Korean singer Rain is a huge hit in Asia, but has struggled to find large success in the U.S..
He starred in last year's "Speed Racer," and has the lead role in "Ninja Assassin".
Rain said he isn't afraid of the hard work it'll take to make him a star in the U.S..
He says he had to go through intense training for "Assassin".
