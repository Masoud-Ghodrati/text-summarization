"Walking Dead" creator hasn't gotten "one dollar in profits," his lawsuit says.
Frank Darabont accuses AMC of "self-dealing" by charging itself a low license fee.
"Walking Dead" fee is half that of "Mad Men," but show gets 4 times the viewers, suit says.
Darabont developed the TV series from Robert Kirkman's comic book series.
