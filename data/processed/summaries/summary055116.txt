Comet ISON discovered in September, should pass within Earth's view this year.
Hubble team: Comet ISON's dust tail could wrap around Earth twice, then some.
It is expected to pass within sun's atmosphere, and it should put on a big show.
Experts: Comet won't threaten Earth, even if sun's heat breaks it apart as it passes.
