The rising star of champion trainer Aidan O'Brien's stable is his own son Joseph.
The pair are the first father-and-son to win the Epsom Derby as trainer and jockey.
Joseph jokes their plans "don't always go to plan" but the pair have had great success.
O'Brien says Joseph could one day take over training at the prestigious Coolmore stable.
