The U.S. Open will be the final grand slam of Kim Clijsters' career.
The Belgian has won at Flushing Meadows three times in the last six years.
Clijsters took the tournament as a wildcard in 2009 after coming out of retirement.
The 31-year-old also claimed the title in 2005 and 2010, but has struggled with injuries recently.
