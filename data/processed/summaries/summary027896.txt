Mario Colao has lost 200 pounds in just under four years.
Three nights of heart attack-like symptoms made him realize he had to make a change.
He stopped smoking two packs of cigarettes a day and quit drinking excessively.
Colao plans to be a certified personal trainer and wants to help people like himself.
