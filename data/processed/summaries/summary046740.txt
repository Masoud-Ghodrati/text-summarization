Ramin Asgard says an Obama-Rouhani handshake turned out to be "too complicated".
Asgard: Near-U.S.-Iran presidential handshake in 1998, but it was complicated then.
But diplomatic signs hopeful, he says, and Obama and Rouhani agree on key principles.
Asgard: For the first time in decades, empowered bilateral diplomacy has a chance.
