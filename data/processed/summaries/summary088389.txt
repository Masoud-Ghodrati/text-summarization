Media on hand for first time in almost 20 years as fallen service member returns.
Air Force Staff Sgt. Phillip Myers, 30, died in Afghanistan on Saturday.
Defense Secretary Robert Gates lifted ban on media coverage, but with conditions.
Some say ban was censorship; others say it showed respect for the fallen.
