Opposition demonstrators march in Kiev protesting deal over Russian military presence.
Deal extends Russia's lease of naval base in Black Sea port for 25 years.
In exchange, Ukraine gets 30 percent cut in price of natural gas from Russia.
Ukraine and Russia had been at odds during previous Ukraine administration.
