Photojournalist Jonathan Alpeyrie has been covering the siege of Donetsk, Ukraine.
Donetsk is held by pro-Russian rebels but the Ukrainian Army has gradually encircled it.
Alpeyrie managed to follow a rebel convoy to a funeral for their fallen fighters.
He and his colleagues were arrested but later released after photographing the scene.
