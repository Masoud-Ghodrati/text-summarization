Former chemist, 34, faces new charges about alleged lying about master's degree.
She pleads not guilty to obstruction charges in two courtrooms Wednesday.
Last month, she was indicted in a third court, in Boston, for alleged misconduct.
It's possible she touched 60,000 samples involved in 34,000 drug cases.
