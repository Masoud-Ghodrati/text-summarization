Blue-footed boobies, Galapagos penguins and marine iguanas are some of the species only found in the Galapagos.
The Galapagos National Park is over 3,000 square miles of islands and islets located 600 miles off Ecuador's mainland.
GNPS designs the itinerary and scheduled landings for every ship to reduce pressure on the islands.
