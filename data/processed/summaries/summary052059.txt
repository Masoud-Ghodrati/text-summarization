A "decree nisi" is granted for celebrity chef Lawson and art collector Saatchi.
After six weeks, the couple can apply for the divorce to be finalized.
The divorce comes weeks after images of Saatchi grabbing her by the throat made headlines.
Lawson and her children moved out of the couple's home after the incident in June.
