A brown bear cub will be stuffed and put on display, Swiss zoo says.
"Cub 4" was killed after its mother neglected it and its father roughed it up.
Dahlholzli Zoo says children will be able to learn from cub's story that "nature can be cruel".
A Danish zoo sparked outrage earlier this year by killing a giraffe and four lions.
