"We vetted this long time ago," says someone assisting the owners of the coins.
In 1901, gold coins worth some $30,000 were stolen from the U.S. Mint in San Francisco.
Last year, a California couple unearthed a stash of coins that had a similar face value.
"If this was U.S. government property we'd be going after it," a mint spokesman says.
