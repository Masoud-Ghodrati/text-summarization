Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin wants to see space travel more accessible to the masses.
He works with the U.S. government to discuss the future of the country's space program.
Private companies are influencing space travel more than in the past, when the government dominated exploration.
Aldrin supports a lottery system for deciding who will become space tourists.
