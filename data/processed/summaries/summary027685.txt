Hawks' general manager was accused of a racially insensitive remark.
The GM was punished; his comment triggered the probe that led to Levenson email.
Levenson wrote that he wanted white cheerleaders and music familiar to whites.
He also said "white fans might be afraid of our black fans," the owner acknowledges.
