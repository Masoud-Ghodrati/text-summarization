NEW: Centrist candidate Rouhani is top vote-getter in very early results.
State media reports about 70% voter turnout in a nation of 50 million eligible voters.
If no candidate gets a majority, there will be a runoff next week.
The last election resulted in bloody street protests known as the "Green Movement".
