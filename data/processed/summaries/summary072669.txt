CEO: Accusations that a company bugged Ecuador's embassy are "completely untrue".
Ecuador says a hidden recording device was found inside its London embassy.
The "spy microphone" was placed in an electrical outlet, the foreign minister says.
He calls for British authorities to assist in Ecuador's investigation.
