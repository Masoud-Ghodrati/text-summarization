There were 516 homicides in the city last year, up from 496 in 2007.
That's still a dramatic change from 1990, when there were 2,262 homicides.
The NYPD cites its Operation Impact as a chief reason for the improvement.
The operation places more uniformed officers in areas where crime rates are high.
