Wadi Rum, nicknamed the Grand Canyon of the Middle East, is a Unesco World Heritage site in Jordan.
The rugged desert wilderness is a traditional home of nomadic Bedouin shepherds.
The most famous foreigner ever traversed this desert is British army officer T.E. Lawrence.
Lawrence's adventure was dramatized in the movie "Lawrence of Arabia," which was partly shot in Wadi Rum.
