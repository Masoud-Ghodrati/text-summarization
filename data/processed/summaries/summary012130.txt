Charles Kaiser: Ed Koch, who died Friday, hadn't been NYC mayor in years; was still a force.
He says Koch embodied NYC in the 20th century, pulled it back from the brink of collapse.
He says Koch had a long, strong record on gay rights, was a good manager, a selfless friend.
Kaiser: Koch stayed relevant; had the ear of every important Democrat, including Obama.
