Police in Georgia release two notes they say are from 19-year-old Geddy Kramer.
Kramer shot six people, then killed himself at FedEx facility last month, police say.
The teen calls himself "a sociopath" who had a history of drug use, mental issues.
He doesn't regret the violence, saying: 'I'm in my happy place'.
