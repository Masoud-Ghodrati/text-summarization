Maria Alyokhina and another punk band member were sentenced in August.
They are serving their two-year prison sentences in a penal colony far from Moscow.
Alyokhina has requested solitary confinement, Russia's state news agency reports.
It cites prison officials as saying she has "strained relations" with other inmates.
