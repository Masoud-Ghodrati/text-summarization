Danish magazine Se Og Hor says it only published pictures of Catherine 10 days ago.
Media reports Friday claimed the magazine had released new, more revealing images.
The royals took legal action against the French magazine that first published the photos.
William and Catherine were on vacation when a photographer took the long lens shots.
