4,000 aviation workers are being furloughed because Congress hasn't approved FAA funding.
Thousands of other workers are also affected because of the failure to pass legislation.
An FAA engineer from Atlanta says, "Congress doesn't care about me at all".
An FAA employee from Seattle calls the failure to pass a bill a "clear attack on middle America".
