"The Fourth Kind" is another horror film relying on the "found footage" technique.
It uses a split screen of "real footage" and re-enactments starring Milla Jovovich.
Officials in Nome, Alaska, where the movie is based, deny those claims, call it science fiction.
Viewers think the use of this technique makes for a good scare, but not authenticity.
