Khat is plant that once chewed gives a mellow high to its consumer.
It's been consumed for centuries by people in the Horn of Africa and parts of the Middle East.
Farmers in Kenya have been hit by a Dutch ban on imports of khat.
Some analysts say there are purported links between the khat trade and terrorist funding.
