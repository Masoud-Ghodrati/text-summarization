Ishinomaki was just one of many Japanese towns hit hard by last year's earthquake and tsunami.
Tokuyoshi Takahashi was forced to lay off the 120 staff at his fish processing factory.
But Takahashi is one of a small group of businessman determined to rebuild the city of 150,000.
They are trying to attract investment in rebuilding to lure back residents who left the town.
