Robert Gupta gave up a career in medicine to play violin for the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
He says homeless street musician Nathaniel Ayers asked for a violin lesson with him.
Through music, Gupta says, the two men were able to communicate and help heal Ayers.
Gupta says music has a powerful ability to connect people and treat mental illness.
