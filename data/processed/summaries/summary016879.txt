Stephen Burt: Seamus Heaney, who died Friday, wrote poetry, literary essays, translations.
His early works were of earth, and of the Troubles; he found fame writing about divided land.
He says later he went south, wrote of civic, family life, dead friends, embraced the numinous.
Burt: He became perhaps the most popular serious poet writing in English anywhere.
