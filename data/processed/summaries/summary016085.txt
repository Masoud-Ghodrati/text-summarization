The trial gets under way in the eastern city of Hefei, officials say.
Gu Kailai and a family aide are accused of murdering a British businessman.
Gu's husband, Bo Xilai, is a former top official who has been stripped of his posts.
The defendants haven't seen their families since April, a friend says.
