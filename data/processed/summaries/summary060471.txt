S. E. Cupp: New CBO report showing minimum wage hike could cost jobs flummoxes Dems.
She says GOP has long held what CBO said; Dems are trying to spin hike as poverty-lowering.
CBO says raising minimum wage could indeed take 900,000 people out of poverty, she says.
Cupp asks: Is doing that while potentially losing 500,000 jobs worth it?.
