The political media wants to know why Hillary Clinton went to Iowa recently.
Paul Begala: They are almost indignant over why she won't declare her candidacy.
Even if she want to run for president, it doesn't make sense to say it now, Begala says.
He says it's just as likely that Hillary has not completely made up her mind.
