Federal agents raided City Hall in Trenton, New Jersey, on Thursday.
They raided the home of the city's mayor, his brother and a campaign supporter Wednesday.
It was not immediately clear why the raids were conducted and authorities declined to elaborate.
Mayor Tony Mack says he has "not violated the public trust in any way".
