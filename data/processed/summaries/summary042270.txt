Mother of victim says she thinks prosecutor did what she could, but evidence was contaminated.
Matthew Barnett pleaded guilty to leaving Daisy Coleman drunk outside her house to fend for self.
He had been charged last year with sexual assault, but those charges were dropped.
Victim says she is happy that Barnett took responsibility.
