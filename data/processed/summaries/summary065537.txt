California's governor signs a law barring those ages 14-18 from using tanning beds.
The law is the most restrictive of any state, though Brazil banned tanning beds altogether.
The bill's author says it will "help save lives and prevent unnecessary suffering".
A WHO agency has classified tanning beds as 'carcinogenic to humans'.
