Felix Magath suggested Brede Hangeland use cheese to cure injury.
He advised the defender use "an old technique of wrapping the knee with Quark.".
Magath and Hangeland have both since left London club Fulham.
American skier Lindsey Vonn also used cheese to cure a shin injury before Olympic success.
