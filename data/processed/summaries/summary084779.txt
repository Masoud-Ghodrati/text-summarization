CNN Hero Dan Wallrath will be featured Sunday on "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition".
Wallrath said thousands of volunteers pitched in to help him build a home in Texas.
The home is for an Army soldier who was injured in the 2009 Fort Hood shootings.
Wallrath: "These families are not going to be forgotten".
