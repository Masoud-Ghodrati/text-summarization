Rachel Canning, 18, is suing her parents for financial support, legal fees, tuition.
She alleges she was verbally and physically abused by her parents and was forced to leave.
Canning's parents say Rachel left on her own and that she is always welcome to come back.
A judge denies her initial requests for immediate financial assistance.
