Beijing-based firm SURE Architecture has proposed a skyscraper mirroring a city infrastructure.
The 300-meter high building is made up of floors of apartments, offices, shops and even parks.
At the heart of the tower, running from the bottom to the top are two "streets".
The proposal has been suggested for London, although it is still in its early stages.
