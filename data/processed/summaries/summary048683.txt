Rep. Giffords plans to go to the shuttle Endeavour launch, her spokesman says.
Her husband, Mark Kelly, will command the mission -- which will be the Endeavour's last.
The hospital where Giffords is rehabbing said Wednesday she "continues to improve".
The man accused of shooting her and 18 others has been indicted on 49 charges.
