Solange Knowles claimed her Afro was searched by the TSA on Wednesday.
She took to Twitter asking fans, "What did TSA find in Solange's Fro?".
The TSA does not have a policy of specifically searching Afros, spokeswoman said.
"It would not be someone's hair but something in someone's hair," she said.
