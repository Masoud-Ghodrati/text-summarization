The Pacific Island nation of Kiribati was once home to more than 200 households.
Today, it lies beneath several meters of turquoise water.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says it is most threatened by rising sea-levels.
The report claims that the island could become uninhabitable as early as 2050.
