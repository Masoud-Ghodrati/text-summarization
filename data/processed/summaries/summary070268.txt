Russia will build up to 8 new reactors in Iran for "atomic energy," state media says.
The announcement comes less than 2 weeks before the deadline in Iran's nuclear talks with the P5+1.
It came a day after Israel warned "there is no moderation in Iran".
Washington vows Iran won't get a nuclear bomb.
