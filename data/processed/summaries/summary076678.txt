Diary of Nazi Party's chief ideologue discovered after missing for 70 years.
Finding the missing diary is "one of great detective stories of our time," ICE director says.
The diary was used against Rosenberg in Nuremberg trials -- he was hanged in 1946.
Diary was likely smuggled out of Germany by one of the Nuremberg prosecutors.
