Van Jones: In the wake of Chris Dorner's death, pundits are talking about his political views.
Jones: We should not give a place in our discourse to the political rantings of a murderer.
He says Dorner killed several people; we should respect families of the victims.
Jones: There are many better spokespeople for the cause of racial justice than Dorner.
