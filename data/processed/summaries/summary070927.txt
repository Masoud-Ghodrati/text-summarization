Frank Ramano's dog, Ty, never made it on his cross-country flight.
Delta says it thinks the dog "may have compromised the kennel on its own".
Ramano says Delta has given him conflicting information on Ty's whereabouts.
A similar incident with a dog happened in 2010 on a Delta flight from Mexico to Canada.
