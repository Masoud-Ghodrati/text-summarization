NEW: Syrian activist says the country is "not a playground for jihad".
Ayman al-Zawahiri's video message is believed to be his first since taking over al Qaeda.
He uses the seven-minute video to discuss Syria and address the protesters.
President Bashar Al-Assad is the "leader of criminal gangs, the protector of traitors," he says.
