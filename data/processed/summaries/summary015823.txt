Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is accused in the Boston Marathon bombing, killing police officer.
He wants to move the trial out of Massachusetts, saying he can't get a fair trial there.
A judge denies his request, saying an "impartial jury" can be impaneled in the area.
Tsarnaev's trial is being delayed, though, until early next year.
