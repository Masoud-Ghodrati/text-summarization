Jeff Pearlman says one's official marathon record is not something a runner takes lightly.
So Paul Ryan claiming to have run 26.2 miles in under three hours seemed amazing, he says.
His time was really 4:01. Ryan says he forgot; Pearlman says this is bogus and a Ryan pattern.
Pearlman: Ryan getting known for distorting truth, even about his respectable marathon time.
