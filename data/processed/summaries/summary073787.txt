Matt Mitrione's suspension is indefinite, Ultimate Fighting Championship group says.
Mitrione, a former NFL player, appeared Monday on a show called "The MMA Hour".
He criticized fighter Fallon Fox: "You lied on your license to beat up women".
UFC says it "finds Mr. Mitrione's comments offensive and wholly unacceptable".
