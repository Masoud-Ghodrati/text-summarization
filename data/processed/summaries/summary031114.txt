Crews working to clean up oil spill on Thai beach at Koh Samet.
Crude spilled on Saturday during transfer of oil from tanker to undersea pipeline.
50,000 liters of oil spilled into the water, though some say it could be more.
PTT says remaining crude will be "90% clear by Friday or Sunday at the latest".
