The state of Florida has launch the month-long 2013 Python Challenge.
The goal is to cull the exploding population of Burmese pythons, wildlife officials say.
Participants are given training for safety, instructed to kill the snakes humanely.
Researchers say pythons have devastated rabbit, fox, opossum and bobcat populations.
