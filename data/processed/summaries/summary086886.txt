NEW: Chief project engineer is "100 percent convinced the airplane is safe to fly".
The Boeing 787's fuel leak was caused by an open valve, Japan Airlines says.
The incident follows an electrical fire on a different JAL Dreamliner in Boston.
The Dreamliner has been hit by a series of glitches following a difficult development.
