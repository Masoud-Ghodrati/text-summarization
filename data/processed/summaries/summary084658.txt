Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has proposed time zone reforms.
Protesters say time zone changes waste energy and negatively affect the elderly.
Chanting "give us our time back," they demand a nationwide referendum on the issue.
Medvedev says the changes help resolve transportation and communication issues.
