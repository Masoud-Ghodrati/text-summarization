Combat control teams are the Air Force's lesser known elite special ops ground force.
They parachute into war zones and help ground force commanders and pilots pinpoint targets.
Combat control teams use special dirt bikes to seize air fields.
They also use airborne surveillance to protect U.S. ground troops and friendly civilians.
