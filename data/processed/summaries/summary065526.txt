Zubeidat Tsarnaev is in a U.S. database that includes terror suspects, official says.
Russia raised concerns to U.S. about her and her son in 2011, sources say.
Zubeidat Tsarnaev's sons are allegedly responsible for the deadly Boston bombings.
She believes the bombings may have been fake and that her sons are innocent.
