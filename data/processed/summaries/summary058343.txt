A Facebook page featuring San Francisco police officer Chris Kohrs is a viral hit.
"The Hot Cop of Castro" loves his job and sees a benefit to the unplanned publicity.
"It has strengthened the bond between the community and the police," he says.
"I've never met the person that created the Facebook page. I'm not even on Facebook".
