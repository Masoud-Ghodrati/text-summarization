Bob Greene: Zimmerman trial riveting, but why limit yourself to TV trials?.
He says in county and local courtrooms across U.S., trials constantly on display. Go watch!.
He says subjects are murder, robbery, financial shenanigans; it's free, tense, fascinating.
Greene: Beyond that, it's American justice carried out for us all; important to bear witness.
