Peter Bergen: CIA learned of al Qaeda operative "the Kuwaiti" through harsh interrogation.
He says another series of interrogations determined the Kuwaiti was bin Laden's courier.
Bergen says it's not clear if the second revelation came before or after harsh techniques.
He says key breakthroughs came from another intelligence service and from CIA agents.
