Colombia's president says Guillermo Enrique Torres was captured Tuesday.
Authorities call him an ideological leader of the FARC, noting his songs promoting the group.
The U.S. State Department had offered a $2.5 million reward for help capturing Torres.
The arrest comes amid improving relations between Venezuela and Colombia.
