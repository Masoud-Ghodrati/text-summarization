Southwest Flight 345's captain took over during LaGuardia landing, NTSB says.
Such a change in that phase of a flight is unusual, aviation experts say.
The pilots reported a wind shift during landing, NTSB says.
The flight landed hard, broke nose gear at New York airport in July, injuring about 10.
