Jonathan Schell says U.S.-Russia treaty lowers ceiling for each country's nuclear arsenals.
But "counting rule" undercuts new limits, theoretically allows more weapons, he says.
Cuts are welcome, he says, but why continue balance of terror long after Cold War's end?.
Schell: Existence of thousands of nukes is failure that outweighs treaty's acheivement.
