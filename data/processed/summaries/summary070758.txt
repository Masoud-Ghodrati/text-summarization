Julian Zelizer: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie is earning praise for tackling budget problems.
He says Christie's focus on cutting spending is a test for the Republican party.
It runs counter to a national GOP trend of stressing issues such as birthright citizenship, he says.
Zelizer: Christie, others in GOP like him could give Democrats trouble in many states.
