Measure sent back to Iraqi Cabinet members for reworking, lawmaker says.
It would have allowed foreign troops to remain in Iraq after December 31.
Bill doesn't apply to U.S. troops, who are to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011.
Lawmakers questioned legitimacy of legislation's first reading or raised other issues.
