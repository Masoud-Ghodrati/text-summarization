A legal loophole allows DNA of executed killers to be added to the FBI database.
An Illinois detective hopes DNA will reveal additional John Wayne Gacy victims.
Gacy was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys in the Chicago area.
He was executed in 1994, before the national DNA database was created.
