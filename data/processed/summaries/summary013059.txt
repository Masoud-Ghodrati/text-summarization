In China the gaokao -- the highly competitive college entrance exams -- dictates the course of a lifetime.
A good score in the gaokao will open the doors to the country's most prestigious universities.
The number of Chinese studying in the US is up from about 60,000 in 2004 to more than 274,000 in 2014.
The majority of students are privately funded and education is now part of a billion dollar industry.
