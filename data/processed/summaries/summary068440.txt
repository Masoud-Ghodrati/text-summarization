Pistorius will appear in court on August 19 over the killing of his girlfriend.
The date would have been Reeva Steenkamp's 30th birthday.
Pistorius says he mistook her for a home invader when he shot her in February.
Police say they expect the case to be postponed while lawyers agree on a trial date.
