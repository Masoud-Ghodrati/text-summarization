World Heritage status has been given to the Nord-Pas de Calais Mining Basin in northern France.
UNESCO says the mining region is a "remarkable cultural landscape".
The Calais basin is one of three mining sites that made the list this year.
The Lakes of Ounianga in Chad were among 26 additions to the heritage list in 2012.
