State Department security officials will accompany U.S. athletes to events.
"It is to make sure we have eyes on the teams and eyes on the events," an official says.
The U.S. team has been warned not to wear their uniforms ''far outside the Olympic venues''.
About 10,000 U.S. citizens are expected to attend the Games, according to estimates.
