Kenny Vance was on tour when Sandy struck; came home to a leveled house.
Vance lived in 1916 Rockaway Beach house for 40 years and cherished it.
His studio, lifetime memorabilia lost; friend saw his records, books floating into the ocean.
Vance is still living in a rented house, trying to deal with red tape and insurance.
