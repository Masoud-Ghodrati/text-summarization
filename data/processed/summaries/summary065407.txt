Boston-born golfer James Driscoll pledges $1,000 for every birdie he makes.
Driscoll cards seven birdies in his opening two rounds and is lucky to make cut.
A record-equaling 91 players play the third after Jesper Parnevik's missed putt.
It moved 21 players above the cut line as second round is completed on Saturday.
