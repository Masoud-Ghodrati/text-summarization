The Order of the Mevlevi, a Sufi sect from the 13th century, are known as "Whirling Dervishes".
Mevlevis aim to act as a bridge between God and humankind through the practice of "sema".
In a prayer-induced trance, they turn, one arm reaching for the sky and one arm down.
Turkey banned the order in 1925 but has since eased restrictions, allowing public worship.
