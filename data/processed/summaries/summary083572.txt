A 43-year-old suspect is due to appear in court Sunday, a police spokesman says.
The man fired two rounds from a starter pistol on a Canal+ set in Cannes, police say.
Christoph Waltz and Daniel Auteuil were doing a live interview at the time.
Canal+ anchor tells viewers: "The shots fired were blanks and the grenade was fake".
