A Lebanese activist group has been painting tires to promote peace and national unity.
Tires, piled and burned to create road blocks, are a symbol of Lebanon's conflicts.
The group, based in Hezbollah's heartland, uses art to lure youth away from sectarianism.
It was founded to help young people traumatized by the 2006 conflict with Israel.
