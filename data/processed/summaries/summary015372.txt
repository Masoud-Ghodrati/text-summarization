Jose Maria Olazabal will not continue as Europe's Ryder Cup captain.
The Spaniard led Europe to a 14½ - 13½ victory over the U.S. in Illinois.
Paul McGinley, one of Olazabal's vice captains, is the early favorite for the role in 2014.
Olazabal received a congratulatory phone call from the King of Spain.
