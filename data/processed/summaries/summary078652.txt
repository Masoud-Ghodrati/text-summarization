An Australian navy ship is expected to keep searching a small area into Tuesday.
It is trying to regain a signal that it picked up Sunday that could be from Flight 370.
If it detects the pings again, it will deploy an underwater vehicle that can look for wreckage.
Without a new signal, the possible area will be larger and take longer to search.
