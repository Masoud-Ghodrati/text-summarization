Schneider, Naga: Amid violence against protesters, Egyptians have lost faith in military.
Protesters demand ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces step aside, they say.
The current parliamentary elections are tainted by the military council, they say.
Egyptians are determined to reclaim their country, Schneider and Naga say.
