The drug lab was once responsible for tests related to thousands of criminal cases.
Massachusetts says Annie Dookhan doctored evidence to change test results at the lab.
Lab directors were "ill-suited" to oversee her and other lab technicians, the report says.
Dookhan, found guilty of multiple charges in the case, was sentenced to prison in November.
