Timothy G. Hendron killed three men and himself at a St. Louis, Missouri, workplace Thursday.
He was one of the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against company retirement plan administrators.
Plaintiffs' attorney: It's unclear if Hendron was to be present at a trial in lawsuit in Kansas City.
Police captain said a motive in the killings at ABB Inc. could remain a mystery.
