The Japanese Prime Minister says he is "extremely concerned" by China's move.
China released a map and coordinates that identify its "Air Defense Identification Zone".
The zone includes islands at the center of a dispute between Beijing and Tokyo.
The U.S. has said the Chinese announcement creates "risks of an incident".
