Nanjing, a city of 8 million in eastern China, was previously the Chinese capital.
Chiang Kai-shek headquartered his nationalist Kuomintang government here until 1949.
Now the city is making a comeback thanks to its links with its republican past.
Tourists flock here to sample the food, music and culture of this era.
