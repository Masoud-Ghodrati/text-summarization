Google provides the setting for the new movie comedy, "The Internship".
The company didn't pay to be in the movie, but it did get a say in how it was depicted.
The movie includes references to Google's self-driving cars but not Google Glass.
Co-founder Larry Page thinks the movie will help with computer science's marketing problem.
