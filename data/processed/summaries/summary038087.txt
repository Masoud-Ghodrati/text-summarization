Jeffrey Toobin says a comment by President Obama led to an awkward moment.
He says Justice Samuel Alito seemed to disagree on Obama's take on campaign finance ruling.
Toobin says Obama was mostly right on the result of recent court decision.
He says Alito also was right to express his view; justices are human beings.
