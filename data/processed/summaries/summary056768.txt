The Virginia Historical Society finds 3,200 slaves named in private documents.
The unpublished documents are from Virginians' attics, basements and desk drawers.
"We sold all the negros 43 in number at astonishingly large prices," an 1858 letter says.
One user of the society's free database of slaves finds the owner of his great-great-great-grandfather.
