Queen Elizabeth II reads a speech to Parliament that sets out the government's agenda.
At its heart is a proposal for a tough new bill on immigration, the government says.
Steps to strengthen the economy are also a priority, the speech says.
The government will continue to press for Scotland to stay within the United Kingdom.
