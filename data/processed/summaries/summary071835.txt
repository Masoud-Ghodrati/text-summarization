Sarah Palin held up a Ready for Hillary magnet during her speech in Iowa on Saturday.
The pro-Clinton super PAC is now using that image to raise money for their efforts to urge Clinton to run for president.
In an email to supporters on Monday, the group offered car magnets similar to the one Palin used during her speech.
