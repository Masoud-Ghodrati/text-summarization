Jim Thorpe was an Olympic medallist, a Hall of Fame football player and a baseball player.
Bob Greene says the life of the "world's greatest athlete" was difficult.
He says towns vied to host his grave and the winner changed the name of the town to honor Thorpe.
Now Thorpe's son is seeking to return his remains to Oklahoma.
