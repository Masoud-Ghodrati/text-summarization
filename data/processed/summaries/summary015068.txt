Monisha Kaltenborn became Formula 1's first female team principal in October.
She is in charge of both business and on-the-track performance of Sauber, sixth in last year's team championship.
Trained as a lawyer, Kaltenborn came to Formula 1 by chance, after joining legal team of one of Sauber's shareholders.
