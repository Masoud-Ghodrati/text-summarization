Alex Ferguson celebrates 25 years as manager of Manchester United this weekend.
The Scot has transformed the English club's fortunes in the past quarter of a century.
Former adversary Howard Wilkinson says Ferguson is nothing like his public persona.
Wilkinson says the 69-year-old will be impossible to replace at Old Trafford.
