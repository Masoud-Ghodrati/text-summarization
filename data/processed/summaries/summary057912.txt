Turkish authorities have blocked YouTube days after banning Twitter.
Government action comes after alleged conversations about war with Syria are leaked.
The leak is "a despicable attack, an act of espionage," the Foreign Ministry says.
Google, which owns YouTube, is looking into the blocking, a spokesperson says.
