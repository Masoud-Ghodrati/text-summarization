South African Imtiaz Sooliman launched the Gift of the Givers Foundation in 1992.
The aid agency is the biggest disaster relief group of African origin.
It has delivered aid to 32 countries, including Haiti, Pakistan and Somalia.
Sooliman says the group proves that Africa can make a positive contribution to the world.
