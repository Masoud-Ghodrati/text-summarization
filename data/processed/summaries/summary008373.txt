Pedro Zapeta was stopped in 2005 trying to take $59,000 home to Guatemala.
Zapeta had paid taxes on the money, didn't know he had to declare it, attorney says.
He was fined $49,000 and left U.S. under threat of deportation.
New ruling says judge applied wrong standard and Zapeta should get some back.
