Ali al-Marri due to appear in court on Tuesday; he's charged with conspiracy.
Last week Supreme Court dismissed al-Marri's challenge of presidential authority.
Al-Marri, a U.S. resident originally from Qatar, has been in custody for 7 years.
He's accused of being a "sleeper agent" for al Qaeda who trained at terror camp.
