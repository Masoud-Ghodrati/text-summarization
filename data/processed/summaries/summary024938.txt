Tuesday marked the last day of the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage that draws over two million Muslim pilgrims.
This year there were 180 ambulances, 22,000 health care professionals and 19,000 units of blood on standby.
To safeguard against the possibility of terrorism, officials installed thousands of CCTV cameras throughout Saudi Arabia.
