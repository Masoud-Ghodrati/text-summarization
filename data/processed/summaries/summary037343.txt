JP Morgan Chase is reported to be in talks with U.S. over $13 billion settlement.
William Black says if reports are correct, the public and shareholders will not see justice.
Reports say California criminal probe will continue, but it's not clear what may result, he says.
Black: Shareholders pay bonuses to execs who profit from frauds, then pay the fines.
