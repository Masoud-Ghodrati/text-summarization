MoveOn.org is a liberal grassroots advocacy group with 8 million members.
There's a vote Tuesday on whether to back a campaign to draft Elizabeth Warren for 2016.
The liberal group is widely expected to approve the vote and put $1 million into the campaign.
MoveOn isn't the only group: Democracy for America is also polling its members.
