FBI was monitoring U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki after the 9/11 attacks in 2001.
Al-Awlaki visited prostitutes, spending more than $2,000, new released papers say.
Cleric knew several 9/11 hijackers, possibly while working as an imam in San Diego.
The FBI released the documents in response to a Judicial Watch FOIA lawsuit.
