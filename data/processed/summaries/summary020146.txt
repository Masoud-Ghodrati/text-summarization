British theater producer David Cecil says a magistrate has dismissed the case against him.
The magistrate said prosecutors had given no evidence to substantiate the charges, he said.
Cecil was detained for staging a play about the challenges faced by homosexuals in Uganda.
Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda, where most gays and lesbians face discrimination.
