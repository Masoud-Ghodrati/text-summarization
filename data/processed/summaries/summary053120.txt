Big-serving Milos Raonic has become the highest-ranked Canadian tennis player.
He went on a nine-match winning streak to claim first title after meeting Pete Sampras.
The 20-year-old has been tipped for the top by Mardy Fish and Andy Roddick.
Raonic moved to Canada from his native Montenegro at the age of three.
