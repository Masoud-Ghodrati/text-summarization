Joe Leydon: Annette Funicello, who died Monday, was the first crush of millions of boys.
They pretty much grew up with her, through Mouseketeers and "Beach Blanket" flicks, he says.
He says boys had to feign disinterest in "Mickey Mouse Club" with buddies.
Funicello embodied an all-American ideal of wholesome, perky, spunky mid-'60s sexuality.
