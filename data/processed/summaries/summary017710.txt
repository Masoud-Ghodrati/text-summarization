Newt Gingrich says ISIS, Hamas and Boko Haram want to impose Islam by force on the world.
Boko Haram threatened its captured girls with death if they didn't convert to Islam, he says.
ISIS wants the same thing for the Yazidi girls they are capturing, he says.
Gingrich: Americans are not "war weary," but even if we were, it would not matter.
