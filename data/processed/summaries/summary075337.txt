Muslims in Sri Lanka are fearful after a wave of deadly violence by Buddhist mobs Sunday.
A hardline Buddhist nationalist group led by monks is accused of inciting the crowds at a rally.
The accused group, Bodu Bala Sena, denies any responsibility for the violence.
A moderate monk who urged interfaith harmony has been abducted and assaulted, police say.
