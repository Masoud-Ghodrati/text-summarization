Six people are missing after trying to climb Mount Rainier.
Park official: It's believed to have fallen in an area with "no viable chance of survival".
Rescue crews discovered tents and climbing gear near Carbon Glacier.
Search will continue by air only, as it's too dangerous to enter from the ground.
