Rawabi is the largest privately-funded development project in Palestinian history.
The finished project will include homes for 40,000 residents, a convention center and three schools.
Its construction provides 5,000 jobs, and there are hopes it will provide more after tenants move in.
The project could lift the economy, but some say it won't change the region's geo-political instability.
