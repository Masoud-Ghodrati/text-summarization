Timothy Yu: ESPN posted article about Jeremy Lin with a headline that was obviously racist.
Yu: Media stereotypes of Asian-Americans are frequently ignored and shrugged off.
He says that even though ESPN took quick action, it's because Lin is a big story right now.
Yu: Lin's success won't end racism, but people will begin to see Asian-Americans differently.
