NEW: Kenyan officials said Ikrima helped recruit Kenyans into Al-Shabaab.
The raid was led by members of SEAL Team Six, the unit that killed Osama bin Laden.
The SEALs withdrew because they came under fire, a U.S. official says.
Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for last month's Kenya mall attack.
