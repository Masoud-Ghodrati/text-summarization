Sen. Bill Nelson is calling for a federal probe into more graves found at a defunct reform school.
There were 31 known graves and a 2009 investigation determined no wrongdoing.
This year, researchers found evidence of 98 deaths and 50 graves.
The century-old school closed last year, allegedly for budget issues.
