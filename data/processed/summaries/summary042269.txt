North Korea's rocket launch failure increases chance of nuclear test, analyst said.
Unha-3 broke up soon after launch, debris crashed into ocean, officials said.
Launch was meant to mark 100 years since the birth of Kim Il-sung.
A nuclear test would also fit North Korea's pattern of serial provocations, analysts said.
