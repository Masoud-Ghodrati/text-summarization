The search for Captain Cook's Endeavour centers on two square miles in Newport.
Cook helped shape the map of the world on board the vessel from 1770.
For years, its whereabouts remained but it is now thought it was scuttled in 1778.
It is part of a total of 13 18th Century ships under water in Newport Harbour.
