Aerospace company Terrafugia is working on the concept of a flying electric car.
Called TF-X, the vehicle is designed to be capable of vertical take-offs and landings.
The goal is to make personal aviation accessible to a broader segment of the population.
The company estimates a period of 8-12 years before it's able to develop TF-X.
