Japan's Kei Nishikori has reached a career high ranking of 15 in the men's game.
The 22-year-old recently won the Japan Open and became first home winner in 40-years.
Nishikori is another product of coach Nick Bolletieri's famous Florida academy.
He makes up for lack of height with on-court speed and a vast array of winners.
