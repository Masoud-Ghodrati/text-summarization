Outbox picks up mail the post office drops off at homes, scans it and e-mails it to recipient.
Austin-based startup is rolling out in its second city, San Francisco, this week.
The service costs $4.99 a month and will still deliver selected physical mail.
The struggling U.S. Postal Service is not working with Outbox.
