NEW: Anders Breivik does not intend to appeal the verdict; prosecution also won't appeal.
The ruling that Breivik is sane means his right-wing views can be tackled, a survivor says.
"This case is going to live strongly with me for the rest of my life," Bjorn Ihler says.
Breivik smiles as is judged to be sane and is sentenced to 21 years in prison.
