NEW: Obama signs a stopgap bill affecting transportation funding, student loan rates.
The larger bill will fund road and bridge construction and repairs for two years.
The bill also includes a measure holding down interest rates on federal student loans.
In recent years, Congress passed short-term extensions of the 2005 highway bill.
