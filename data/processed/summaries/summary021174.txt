Human Rights Watch: Libya should investigate rebels who killed Gadhafi forces.
Witness in Gadhafi inner circle describes dictator on the run, eating food in empty houses.
Trying to escape, the leader's guards threw grenades but one bounced back and exploded.
A mob descended on Gadhafi October 20, but it's still unclear how he died, HRW says.
