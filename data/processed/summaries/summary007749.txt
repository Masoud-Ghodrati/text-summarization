Aaron Carroll: Opponents of health reform say emergency rooms give health care to all.
Not true, he says. ERs can't refuse emergency care but not required to give other care.
He says other misconception is treatment costs easily written off; in fact, billers will pursue.
Carroll: Yes, hospitals need money; important to realize ER care no substitute for reforms.
