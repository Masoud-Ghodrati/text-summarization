Michael Coogan: Bible seen as unassailable divine authority, but it was written by men, not God.
Written over course of 1,000 years, each writer reflecting values of his day, he writes.
Much in Bible rejected: Slavery, women as property, pork as abomination, Coogan says.
Coogan: Bible's true timeless message is equal, even loving, treatment of all people.
