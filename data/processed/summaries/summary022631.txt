More than 2,000 invitations to Margaret Thatcher's funeral are being sent out.
Former U.S. presidents and Hillary Clinton are among those invited to the service.
Anarchists reportedly plan mass "party" Saturday to celebrate Thatcher's death.
Thatcher was widely admired on the global stage but is a highly polarizing figure in UK politics.
