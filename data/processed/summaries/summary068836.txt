Cirque du Soleil shocked a Beijing audience by screening an image of "tank man".
The politically-charged image of the sole protester defying tanks in Tiananmen is banned in China.
The troupe says the show's content was approved ahead of time by Chinese censors.
It has removed the image from its remaining Chinese performances.
