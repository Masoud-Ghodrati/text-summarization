Kentucky Children's Hospital refuses to provide data on pediatric heart surgery deaths.
The hospital's chief heart surgeon went on paid leave and surgeries stopped in October.
Official promises when the surgeries resume, improvement will be seen.
That's too late for the children who died after surgery, their parents say.
