18-year-old Mumtaz bears the scars of an acid attack after she refused marriage.
Two armed men pulled her head back and poured acid all over her face.
Mumtaz now lives in a shelter for abused women in Kabul, Afghanistan.
A 2008 Global Rights study said 87% of Afghan women reported suffering from domestic abuse.
