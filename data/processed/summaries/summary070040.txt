Vice President Biden tells CNN's "New Day" he'll decide on a presidential bid in mid-2015.
Biden sounds raring to go, but his words hint Hillary Clinton has the edge.
Among Democrats, Biden looks good against candidate ABC (Anybody But Clinton).
If he runs and wins in 2016, Biden would be the oldest to begin a presidency.
