Activision Blizzard has filed a motion to dismiss Manuel Noriega's lawsuit.
Ex-New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is representing the "Call of Duty" video games creator.
He calls the lawsuit "absurd" and a violation of free speech.
Noriega says the video game damaged his reputation and he's entitled to part of the profits.
