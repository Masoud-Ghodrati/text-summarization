U.N. registered 51.2 million as refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced last year.
Afghans, Syrians and Somalis make up more than half the total 16.7 million refugees.
"We are seeing here the immense costs of not ending wars," says UNHCR chief.
More than a million people have been displaced in Iraq just this year by violence.
