The Nonhuman Rights Project is filing suits on behalf of four captive chimpanzees.
The owners of the four chimpanzees have not commented on the lawsuits.
The lawsuits seek the animals' "right to bodily liberty" and their placement in a sanctuary.
The activist group says it plans to file more suits on behalf of elephants, dolphins and whales.
