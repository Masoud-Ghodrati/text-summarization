Nigeria's government said the deal to release the girls was part of a ceasefire agreement.
Boko Haram has not confirmed the deal, and continuing battles have been tied to them.
Experts have doubts the deal will materialize; they say seeing is believing.
Militants kidnapped some 276 girls in April and are believe to be holding some 200 of them.
