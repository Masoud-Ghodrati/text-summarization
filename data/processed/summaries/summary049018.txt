Hong Kong authorities start clearing barricades at a section of a downtown protest camp.
The clearance followed a court order to remove obstructions outside CITIC Tower.
No sign of resistance from protesters, some of whom helped move metal barricades.
However, protest leaders have vowed not to leave the protest site.
