Indian prime minister says India needs "vast improvements" on women's safety.
The alleged rape of a 5-year-old girl has sparked demonstrations all weekend in India.
The girl is recovering and is in stable condition, doctors say.
This is the latest high-profile alleged rape in India, after a gang rape on a bus in December.
