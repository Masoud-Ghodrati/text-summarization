Alanis Morissette told Health magazine that she had an eating disorder as a teen.
Morissette now is focusing on her diet as "a sort of spiritual practice".
Her new outlook has spread to the way she views balancing all aspects of her life.
She hopes to be a role model for other girls struggling with eating disorders.
