Cuomo called for leaders to calm the rhetoric after two NYPD officers were murdered this weekend.
Cuomo said he favored a productive conversation after a "cooling off period" and wouldn't point fingers.
Cuomo said the jury decision in the Eric Garner case "was seemingly wholly incongruous" with the video of his death.
He added that there were "legitimate points" in the Garner case.
