Steve Rushin says buzzing at World Cup is vuvuzelas, horns played by South African fans.
They drive people crazy, he says; even muting TV won't take the sound out of your ears.
But raucous chants at most soccer matches are not exactly music either, he says.
Rushin: Vuvuzela may by infuriating, but it's also joyful and is the sound of South Africa.
