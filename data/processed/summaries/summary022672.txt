Family was told that 12-year-old girl received HIV-positive blood, Human Rights Commission says.
Health Ministry calls the incident a "critical error," apologizes, says it's investigating.
7 ministry officials were sacked and some were fined, including an AIDS program coordinator.
It's not known if the girl has HIV; a lawyer says the family plans to sue the Health Ministry.
