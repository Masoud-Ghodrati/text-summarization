Julian Zelizer: President Obama's speech outlined a vision for his second term.
He says the president placed emphasis on the economy and on combating inequity on taxes.
The speech is not likely to be a game changer, he says.
Zelizer: Obama's re-election bid will likely be decided by events and his actions next fall.
