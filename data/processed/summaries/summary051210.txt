Steve Politi says Alex Rodriguez's contract is the worst in sports history.
The Yankees still must pay him more than $90 million over the next four years.
Rodriguez will be 42 when the contract finally runs out.
Rodriguez has hit 647 career home runs but has yet to play this season because of injury.
