Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky will attend a Manhattan luncheon tomorrow for the Ann Romney Center.
Mitt and Ann Romney will also attend, according to two sources familiar with the event.
The meetings will come days after Mitt Romney, who is floating his own 2016 run, dinged Hillary Clinton in a speech.
