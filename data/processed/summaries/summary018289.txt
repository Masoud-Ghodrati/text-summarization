Paris Hilton called sex tape "the most embarrassing humiliating thing" she has been through.
She hopes new show, "The World According To Paris" will clear misconceptions.
Hilton: "People assume that everything was handed to me and I've never had to work".
As a child, Hilton was a tomboy who wanted to be a veterinarian.
