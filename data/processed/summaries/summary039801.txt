NEW: I-25 in northern Colorado reopens, though visibility is still poor, a state agency says.
A burning semi-tanker was among 20-50 vehicles involved in wrecks there.
Part of Interstate 70 was also shut down, as Colorado got hit hard by the spring snowstorm.
The storm is now heading into the Midwest and could eventually hit Washington.
