In Congo, militia groups and army factions control many mines, says Robin Wright.
Minerals in these mines go into cell phones, laptops, digital cameras and other products.
Congolese mine work is back-breaking, perilous and poorly paid, Wright says.
In Congo, more than 5 million have died through war and hardships in the past decade.
