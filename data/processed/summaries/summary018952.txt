David Torrance: Margaret Thatcher biopic "The Iron Lady" a nostalgia trip.
The movie shows Thatcher as PM in the 1980s, and as a frail elderly woman, suffering from dementia.
Torrance: 1980s were a time "when politics was politics and elected leaders actually believed in something".
He says "The Iron Lady" may prove "useful propaganda" for the Conservative Party.
