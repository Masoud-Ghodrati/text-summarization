Marilyn Davenport apologizes once again for forwarding e-mail.
The e-mail contained a doctored photo of a chimpanzee with Obama's face on it.
Davenport insists she is not racist and that she thought the e-mail was "political satire".
Davenport says she was focused on concerns about where the president was born.
