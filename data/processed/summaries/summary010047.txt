Villagers in China's Sichuan province build a $2.1M "money wall" out of year-end bonuses.
They run a rural co-operative that invests in farmland and hydropower plants.
The money was heavily guarded before being distributing in time for Chinese New Year.
Guard: "It was so uncomfortable sleeping on so much money".
