J.R. Celski takes bronze in the 1,500-meter short-track speed skating at Olympics.
Two of the South Koreans leading the group unexpectedly crash in race.
Five months ago, Celski's left thigh was sliced opened by skate blade.
He returned to the ice for first time just eight weeks before the Olympics.
