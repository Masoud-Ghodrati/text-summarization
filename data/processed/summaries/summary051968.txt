Billions of locusts infest half of Madagascar and could cover 2/3 of the island nation.
Without action, the flying bugs could plague the country for 10 years, a U.N. official says.
"You turn around, there are locusts everywhere," he says, noting swarms stretch for miles.
Locusts devour crops and pastureland, which could devastate Madagascar's poor.
