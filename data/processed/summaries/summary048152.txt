Boeing's entire fleet of 787 Dreamliners has been grounded over a battery fire risk.
Grounding stalls the Dreamliner programme, which has a backlog of about 800 orders.
Murdo Morrison says the grounding demonstrates the rigor of aviation regulation.
Best case scenario is that the battery problem is isolated, Morrison says.
