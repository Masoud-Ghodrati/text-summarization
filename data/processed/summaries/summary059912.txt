Daniel Yellin. An article depicted UPenn culture of female students casually "hooking up".
He says article portrayed male students as taking advantage of drunk women, bragging about it.
He says characterization is unfair; college takes consent seriously.
Yellin: Many young men wouldn't dream of mistreating women; they respect women's decisions.
