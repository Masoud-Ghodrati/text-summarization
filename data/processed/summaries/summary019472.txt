Chinese police intercepted more than 3,600 crocodiles near China-Vietnam border.
It is believed the animals were headed to restaurants in nearby Guangdong province.
The Siamese crocodiles are near extinction in the wild, though they are bred in captivity.
Southern China provinces made up nearly 70% of all Chinese animal trafficking last year.
