The House OKs $1 million for a USDA investigation of a California slaughterhouse.
Authorities recalled nearly 9 million pounds of meat from there in February.
A congressman says investigators have been too slow to make information public.
"We have more information from CNN than ... from the (the) USDA," he says.
