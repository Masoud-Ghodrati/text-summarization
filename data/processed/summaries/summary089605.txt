Jeffrey Bellin: Until recently, Florida's self-defense law included a "duty to retreat".
In 2005, Florida overrode law enforcement objections, adopted a "stand your ground" rule.
Bellin says that even on a sidewalk, people may defend themselves with deadly force.
He says "Stand your ground" may ultimately decide outcome of Trayvon Martin shooting.
