Police used a stun gun on an 8-year-old girl last October in Pierre, South Dakota.
The girl's mother is suing the city, the former police chief, and four officers.
Former chief said officers may have saved girl's life by "tasing" her when she threatened herself.
Lawsuit seeks more than $100,000 in damages, plus other compensation.
