Tonyaa Weathersbee calls the verdict in the Michael Dunn murder case a hollow victory.
Dunn admitted firing into an SUV, killing Jordan Davis, 17, but said it was in self-defense.
Dunn was found guilty of three counts of second-degree attempted murder.
The Florida jury could not reach a verdict in the murder charge for Davis' death.
