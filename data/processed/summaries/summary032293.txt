Kamal Ganzouri was an Egyptian deputy prime minister in the late 1980s.
In 1996, President Hosni Mubarak appointed him as Egypt's prime minister.
Political leaders criticized Ganzouri after he left office in 1999, state media says.
A military spokesman says Ganzouri has agreed to become prime minister again.
