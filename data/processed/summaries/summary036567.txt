Auroras Encore defies the odds to win Saturday's Grand National at Aintree.
Ryan Mania rides the 66-1 outsider to victory in jockey's debut appearance.
Only 17 of 40 entrants complete race, but no repeat of last year's two horse deaths.
However, two horses died following races earlier in the three-day meeting.
