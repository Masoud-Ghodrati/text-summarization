Jocelyne Cesari: Opposition to mosques shows a growing unease and fear of Islam.
Opponents mix up terrorists spouting Islamic rhetoric with the religion, she says.
Cesari points out Christianity was not blamed for the terrorism during Northern Ireland conflict.
She says rather than demonize the "Other," we must imagine Muslims as fellow citizens.
