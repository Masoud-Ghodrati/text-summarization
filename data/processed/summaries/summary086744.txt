Serena Williams has had a resurgence under Patrick Mouratoglou's guidance.
American had sunk to 175 in world and lost in 2012 French Open first round.
But with French coach's input Williams won final two grand slams last year.
World No. 1 won 11 titles in 2013, the best return since Martina Hingis in 1997.
