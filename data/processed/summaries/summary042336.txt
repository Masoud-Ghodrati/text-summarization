Bob Greene: After Nixon vs. Kennedy in 1960, there were no presidential debates until 1976.
He says Nixon's sweaty showing in '60 helped put candidates off TV debates.
In subsequent campaigns, neither LBJ nor Nixon debated their rivals.
Greene: Now debates are nearly mandatory, much as candidates might like to avoid them.
