NEW: Those behind a small car bomb in Belfast show a "callous disregard" for the public, police say.
A Northern Ireland government minister blames dissident IRA groups for the device in Newry.
The abandoned van contained two large barrels of homemade explosives and a detonator.
Police: "Anyone within 50 meters of this device would have been killed".
