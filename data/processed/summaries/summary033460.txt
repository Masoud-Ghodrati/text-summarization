Wladimir Klitschko tells CNN his gold at the Atlanta Olympics is one of his career highlights.
Current WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champ took gold in the super heavyweight division in 1996.
The 36-year-old auctioned his medal for $1 million to help his charitable foundation.
Klitschko says he will fight again before the end of this year.
