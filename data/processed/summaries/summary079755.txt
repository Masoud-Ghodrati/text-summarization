NEW: Ex-PM Gordon Brown is "shocked" by the latest claims.
"It is very personal and really hurtful if all true," former prime minister's wife says in tweet.
The allegations about Brown widen a scandal that sunk Britain's News of the World.
The scandal threatens News International's plan to create the largest British media company.
