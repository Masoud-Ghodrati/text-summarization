For the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by ZIP code on YouTube.
U.S. Chamber of Commerce is running the ads in seven New York state districts.
The technology to target ads to specific ZIP codes was just released in March by Google.
Google says collected data does not contain any personally identifiable information.
