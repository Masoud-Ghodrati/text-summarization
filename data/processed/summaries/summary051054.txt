NEW: Milbury and NBC agree "he should remain off air" after the incident, NBC says.
Police say the incident occurred at a pee wee game involving a team that Milbury helps coach.
Milbury's lawyer says his client "simply intervened in an altercation" involving his son.
He played 12 seasons for the Boston Bruins, then became a coach, executive and TV analyst.
