NEW: State news: Woman had 10 registered children in 2 locations; man had 4 others.
A blonde, blue-eyed girl was found living with a Roma couple she does not resemble.
DNA testing proved she was not their child, police say, and she's now in the care of a charity.
The couple posing as her parents have been arrested on suspicion of abducting a minor.
