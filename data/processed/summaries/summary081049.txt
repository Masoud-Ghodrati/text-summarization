China has urged the Philippines to "guarantee the safety" of fishermen accused of poaching.
12 Chinese nationals were arrested on April 8 after their ship ran aground on a reef.
The coral reef was the same marine park where a U.S. Navy minesweeper ran aground.
Tubbahata Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage site with restricted access.
