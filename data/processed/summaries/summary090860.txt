NEW: Former basketball star Dennis Rodman arrives Pyongyang, capital of North Korea.
The trip is the second by the celebrity-turned-envoy this year to visit Kim Jong Un.
He denies he will seek the release of U.S. captive Bae, but has previously said he will broach the issue.
Bae was sentenced to 15 years hard labor in February over unspecified "hostile acts" against North Korea.
