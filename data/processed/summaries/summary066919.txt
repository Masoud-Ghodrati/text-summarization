The man told police he was on a jet ski in Jamaica Bay, adjacent to the airport.
He got stranded, he said, and climbed onto the tarmac at Kennedy Airport.
The airport's multi-million-dollar security system failed to detect him.
The Port Authority is calling for "an expedited review of the incident".
