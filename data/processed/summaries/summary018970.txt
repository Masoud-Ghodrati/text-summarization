Pilot who executed a textbook belly landing in Poland is being hailed as national hero.
Tadeusz Wrona has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years.
"I finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty," he says.
Wrona says he's flown the Boeing 767 about 500 times and never had any trouble.
