Claims of sexual abuse have been made against a late BBC children's TV presenter.
Five women say Jimmy Savile abused them when they were teenage girls.
The BBC says it is horrified by the claims of abuse, dating back to the 1960s and 1970s.
A nephew of Savile, who was knighted for his charitable work, defends his reputation.
