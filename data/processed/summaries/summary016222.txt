NEW: The jury in the trial of Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo will continue deliberations Friday.
The Italian sisters deny embezzling money from their former employers.
At the trial, they alleged repeated drug use by celebrity chef Nigella Lawson.
The prosecution says the sisters abused their position by buying luxury goods for themselves.
