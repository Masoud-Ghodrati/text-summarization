David Paterson's approval ratings are below 20 percent; he met Obama last week.
It's been reported that White House urged him not to run for re-election in 2010.
"I realize that there are people who don't want me to run," Paterson says Sunday.
If Paterson loses, it could adversely affect down-ticket races.
