Chief Leonard Gallo's attorney says his retirement is not an admission of wrongdoing.
Four East Haven officers were arrested last week as part of a federal investigation.
A Latino community member says Gallo cultivated a "racist and dishonest police force".
East Haven's mayor recently apologized for remarks on Latinos some called insensitive.
