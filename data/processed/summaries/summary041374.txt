Patrice Evra fails in his appeal against a five-match ban from the French national team.
Evra was one of four players banned for their part in boycotting training during World Cup.
Manchester United defender was the only player who appealed against his ban.
He will not be eligible to play for his country until friendly match against Brazil in 2011.
