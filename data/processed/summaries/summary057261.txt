Billy Powell called 911 Tuesday night complaining of chest pains, police say.
Paramedics found him unresponsive and he was pronounced dead at the scene.
Powell, 56, survived 1977 plane crash that killed Ronnie Van Zant and 5 others.
"Thanks for being you," one mourning fan writes on Lynyrd Skynyrd Web site.
