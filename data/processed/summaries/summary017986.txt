Mario Balotelli and Roberto Mancini were embroiled in bust up in training on Thursday.
The Manchester City striker and manager had to be separated by coaching staff.
The scuffle was sparked by Balotelli's hostile challenge on a fellow player.
Mancini downplayed the incident on Friday, saying he would give Balotelli more chances.
