A retired bishop and a retired priest have been arrested by British police on suspicion of sexual offences.
The pair are understood to have worked alongside each other in the Chichester Diocese.
Police say the Church of England is co-operating fully with them.
Sussex Police insists that there are "no allegations of recent or current offending".
