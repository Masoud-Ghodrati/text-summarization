A 95-year-old woman was held up by TSA officers at a Florida airport, her daughter says.
The agents forced the cancer-stricken woman to take off her adult diaper, she adds.
The TSA insists its officers "acted professionally and according to proper procedure".
The woman's daughter says those procedures should be changed.
