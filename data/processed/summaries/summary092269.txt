NEW: The U.S. Embassy in Amman appeared to be among the targets, a source says.
The plot involved "11 terrorists associated with the ideology of Al Qaeda," Petra reports.
The plan would use "explosives, booby-trapped cars, submachine guns and mortars," Petra says.
The last Al Qaeda attack in Jordan targeted an Amman hotel November 9, 2005.
