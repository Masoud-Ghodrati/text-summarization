Yehiel Grenimann is based in Jerusalem and works with Rabbis for Human Rights.
Grenimann says Hamas, Tel Aviv have repeatedly chosen conflict over real negotiations.
There is no prospect for peace if extremists in the government have their way, he says.
Palestinians also need to reject the ways of Hamas as haters of Israel, Grenimann says.
