N. Korea says it will attack Japanese military, "major targets," if it shoots down rocket.
Japan recently mobilized its missile defense system in response to planned launch.
N. Korea said it would conduct launch between April 4 and April 8.
Sources say "bulbous" shroud atop rocket could indicate satellite aboard.
