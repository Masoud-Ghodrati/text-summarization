Some stranded on the Akademik Shokalskiy since Christmas have sent an upbeat message.
YouTube video: "Lots of snow and lots of ice, lots of penguins, which are very, very nice!".
"The French dropped by, but couldn't get near. Bloody great shame we're still stuck here!".
A helicopter is expected to pick up 52 passengers, and the 22 crew members will stay aboard.
