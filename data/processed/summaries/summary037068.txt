Tim Stanley: Hillary Clinton bashed by GOP, praised by Obama and still front-runner.
He says she has new book, top anchors interviewing her; this usually signals candidacy.
She must deal with two compromised records, with two administrations, he says.
Stanley: GOP weighing many candidates. Dems offering one. Do voters want another Clinton?.
