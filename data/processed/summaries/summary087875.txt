The organization's CEO says the changes have nothing to do with Planned Parenthood snafu.
Nancy Brinker will leave her job as CEO 30 years after founding Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
The foundation's president is also leaving the organization in September.
The announcement comes months after a controversy over funding for Planned Parenthood.
