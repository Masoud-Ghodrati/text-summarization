A decades-old policy has prevented Rohingya from being full citizens in Myanmar.
More than 100,000 have fled by boat since sectarian violence in Rakhine state in 2012.
In Sittwe, the Muslim minority are forced to live in areas from which they cannot leave.
"If I go to Sittwe on my own," says one Rohingya man. "I think the Rakhine will kill me".
