Iberia pilots plan a one-day strike every Monday and Friday until July.
They see a threat to their jobs or working conditions from budget airline Iberia Express.
Monday's strike led to 124 canceled flights, 38% of Iberia's scheduled flights.
Iberia has filed a court complaint against the pilots; a ruling could still be weeks away.
