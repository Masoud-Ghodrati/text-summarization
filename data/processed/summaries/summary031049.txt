Lesley Abdela: Besides being prime minister, Thatcher did little to promote women in politics.
Abdela says a generation in Britain grew up knowing only a female prime minister.
She says like many, she feels ambivalence toward Thatcher, a divisive but influential leader.
Abdela: So powerful, she could have advanced women in politics but chose not to do so.
