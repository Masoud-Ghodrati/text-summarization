Brian Holloway was in Florida when he heard about a wild party at his New York home.
The former NFL player says tweets told of teens partying with alcohol and drugs.
The partygoers stole property, spray-painted graffiti, caused $20,000 in damage, he says.
He says 200 partygoers have been identified, and the last 100 will be in the next few days.
