Energy companies in the UK see potential from underwater turbines that produce electricity.
The energy is consistent and predictable; companies can model output 100 years in the future.
Meygen has placed four turbines in the north of Scotland to tap the tidal power of Pentland Firth.
The energy source has the potential to produce 1.2GW, the equivalent of two nuclear power plants.
