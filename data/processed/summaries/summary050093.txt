Myanmar's government is considering a law banning interfaith marriage.
It is in response to a call from extremist Buddhist monks to "protect race and religion".
Myanmar has been plagued by violence between Buddhists and Muslims in recent years.
Rights organizations fear such laws will create further divisions and prejudice.
