Paula Kassig asks ISIS to respond to the family's plea for her son's life.
"Please tell us what more we can do," she says via Twitter.
Her son converted to Islam in captivity and took the name Abdul Rahman Kassig.
He was threatened at the end of a video showing the killing of UK hostage Alan Henning.
