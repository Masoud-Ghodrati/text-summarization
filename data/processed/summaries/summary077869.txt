NORAD jets escort the plane to airport in Mount Airy, North Carolina.
U.S. Capitol, the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court evacuated, police said.
The evacuation was ordered after authorities were unable to immediately contact the pilot.
The FAA is looking into why the pilot entered restricted airspace without authorization.
