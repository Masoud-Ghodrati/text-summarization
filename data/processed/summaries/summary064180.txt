At least 3 people dead, 52 injured after Buddhist mobs attacked Muslim areas in Sri Lanka.
The rampage followed a rally by a hardline Buddhist nationalist group led by monks.
The rally was prompted by the alleged assault of a monk by Muslim youths days earlier.
The towns, popular tourist destinations, are now subject to a curfew.
