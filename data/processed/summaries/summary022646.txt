Bodies of a man, 43, and his daughters, ages 9 and 4, were discovered Tuesday.
They were found in on-post housing at Fort Hood, authorities say.
"Early indications are the deaths are possibly the result of a tragic murder-suicide," the Army said.
The three were dependents of a female soldier who recently returned from a deployment.
