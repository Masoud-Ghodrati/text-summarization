Stephany Flores' family speaks to Holloway's mother for the first time, victim's brother says.
The two families are linked by Joran van der Sloot, held over Flores killing.
Van der Sloot twice arrested but never charged over Natalee Holloway disappearance.
Enrique Flores hopes Van der Sloot trial can ease both families' pain.
