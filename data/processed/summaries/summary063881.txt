James Martin: Jesuits wonder if Pope Francis, when elected, was still a member of their order.
Martin: He has identified with the Jesuits, and his life reflects the order's teachings.
Humility, poverty, prayer and "finding God in all things" are Jesuit ideals, he says.
Martin: Pope Francis is a great leader who would please St. Ignatius, founder of Jesuits.
