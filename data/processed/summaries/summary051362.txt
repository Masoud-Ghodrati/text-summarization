Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel were both nurtured by the same man.
They were guided in their junior careers by Gerhard Noack in the town of Kerpen.
Noack was introduced to karting through his friendship with the Schumacher family.
He says four-time champion Vettel will eclipse Schumacher's record seven titles.
