"Victim 9" was one of 10 victims in the Jerry Sandusky sexual abuse case.
He claims he was unable to reach a settlement with Penn State University.
26 men have settled claims totaling $59.7 million, the university said in October.
Sandusky was convicted in 2012 in a case that scandalized the fabled college football program.
