The 12 sketches date from when Adolf Hitler was trying to get into art school.
All the sketches are signed and some even have Hitler's Vienna address.
They're expected to bring between $6,100 and $9,100 each at auction.
Drawings all date from around 1908 and 1909, when Hitler was a "penniless dropout".
