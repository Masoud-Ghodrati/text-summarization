Many earthquake victims were dumped in mass graves about 45 minutes northeast of capital.
Daniel Rouzier says "total lack of respect for the dead" is countercultural to Haiti.
Rouzier ordered equipment to dig fresh trenches, commissioned 5 metal crosses.
"I'm very grateful to be able to do this," says Rouzier, who owns a car dealership.
