NEW: A federal jury in New York begins deliberations in Adis Medunjanin's case.
He is accused of conspiring with two others to bomb New York's subway system.
His defense lawyer denies that his client was part of any such plot.
Medunjanin went to Pakistan to join the Taliban, not al Qaeda, his lawyer says.
