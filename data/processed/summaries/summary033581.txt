Elvis Presley fan Henrik Knudsen has created a larger-than-life replica of Graceland in Denmark's Jutland region.
Graceland Randers features a $1.6 million-valued collection of Elvis memorabilia.
The venue will mark Elvis's 80th birthday with a performance featuring some of the King's old backing band.
