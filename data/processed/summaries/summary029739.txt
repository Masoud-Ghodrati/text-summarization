After reunification, the Berlin Wall was largely demolished by the city government.
Pieces were auctioned as art objects, purchased or donated to museums around the world.
A few segments have over time ended up in some unexpected locations.
Parts of the Wall can now be seen in a men's room in a Vegas casino and a news company office in Argentina.
