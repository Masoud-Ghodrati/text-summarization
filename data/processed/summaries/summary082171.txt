A disabled pensioner from the north east of England was mugged and left with a broken collar bone.
After reading his story on a British website, beautician Katie Cutler organized an online fundraising page to fund his new home.
Donations have surpassed Â£300K ($452K) and are growing, as well as offers to fit a kitchen and decorate his home.
