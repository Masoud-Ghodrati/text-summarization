Oscar Pistorius is selling the home "to cover his increasing legal costs".
He's on trial for murder in the death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp.
His home, where Steenkamp died, has been sealed since it was handed back to him.
Pistorius "cannot contemplate ever returning to live there again," a statement says.
