Nick Chipman's bucket list included a bucketful of sandwiches wrapped into one.
He ordered each breakfast, lunch sandwich at a McDonald's in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin.
To keep the McEverything together, he used "lots and lots of bamboo skewers".
He's not done: "I think my next plan is to make some custom giant tortilla" at Taco Bell.
