Kristin Hopkins, a single mother of four, was reported missing on April 29.
She was found May 4 in her car on a steep hillside, about 50 yards from the highway.
She is in critical but stable condition, a family spokesman says.
Hopkins tried to use an umbrella with notes on it to signal she needed help.
