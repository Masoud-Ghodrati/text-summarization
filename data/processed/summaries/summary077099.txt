Seven Hong Kong police officers are arrested for an alleged assault on a protester.
Footage of the alleged assault, in which the man was kicked and punched, caused outrage.
Authorities cleared a major pro-democracy protest site in Mong Kok Wednesday.
But hours after the road reopened, protesters took to the streets threatening to reoccupy.
