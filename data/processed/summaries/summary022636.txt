Gavrilo Princip fired the shot that started World War I when he killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
Princip, a Slav nationalist, wanted to drive the Austro-Hungarians out of Bosnia.
He was a high school student when he carried out the assassination, in Sarajevo.
He got close to his victim purely by chance, and only fired one shot.
