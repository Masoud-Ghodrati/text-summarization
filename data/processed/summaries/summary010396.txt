Vicenzino: Berlusconi's influence on Italian affairs will continue for foreseeable future.
Italy "increasingly a nation of pensioners, ruled by pensioners for the sake of pensioners".
Italy's political establishment "pales in competence when compared to its entrepreneurial class".
Over time, Berlusconi has largely become the victim of his own hubris, Vicenzino says.
