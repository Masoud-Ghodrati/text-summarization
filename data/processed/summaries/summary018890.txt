Nelson Mandela, who freed South Africa of apartheid, has died at age 95.
John Battersby: Mandela said that being in prison for 27 years changed his world view.
"One of the most difficult things is not to change society ... but to change yourself," Mandela said.
Battersby: Mandela's strength of character made him a potent leader and example for humanity.
