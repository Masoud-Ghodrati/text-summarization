Elliot Sudal, 24, made waves when he wrestled a shark on a Nantucket beach.
He says he's caught and released about 100 sharks in the past eight months.
Sudal has received criticism over concerns about injuring the sharks.
"I just played around with this guy," he says. 'It's like a connection with the animal".
