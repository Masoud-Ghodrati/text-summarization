Prosecutors allowed grenade parts to flow across the border with Mexico, according to a new IG report.
Mexican and U.S. authorities planned a sting, but lost track of the suspect who sold the grenade parts.
Grenade hulls were used in violent attacks by Mexican cartels, but are available in the U.S. in military supply stores.
