Peggy Drexler: Future NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio's family is all-American in a striking new way.
Drexler: His wife is black and two children are biracial, and they are charming and fun.
Drexler: Number of interethnic married couples growing; number of biracial folks climbing.
She says voters respond to families, interracial or not, with the values of de Blasios.
