An ex-AAU CEO is accused of sexually abusing boys while he was a YMCA coach.
The AAU got "cryptic" messages in November and did its own probe, a spokesman says.
The group notified Memphis police last week, setting off its investigation, he adds.
ESPN aired a report Sunday featuring two alleged accusers of Robert "Bobby" Dodd.
