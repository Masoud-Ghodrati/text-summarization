Buzz Aldrin posted what he calls "the world's first space selfie," taken in 1966.
It was captured while he was shooting pics of ultraviolet stars while on the Gemini 12 mission.
"I didn't realize I was pioneering the selfies," Aldrin told CNN.
Today it's a fairly popular past-time for astronauts to send selfies home from space.
