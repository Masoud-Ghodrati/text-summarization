Girl gets historic baseball back after suing Phillies and Ryan Howard.
Ball was 200th homer for Howard, the fastest any player had achieved the feat.
Girl was first given cotton candy and an autographed ball in questionable exchange.
Outraged mom came to her defense: "It's my daughter. It's my blood".
