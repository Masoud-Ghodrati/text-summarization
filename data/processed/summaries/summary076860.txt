John Avlon says some conservatives are starting to give Jon Huntsman another look.
He says Huntsman a modern anomaly: a cool conservative with campaign of civility, ideas.
He says White House worries about him; as GOP candidates fall, his prospects are rising.
Avlon: GOP is wary of Huntsman's style, but should consider electability, substance.
