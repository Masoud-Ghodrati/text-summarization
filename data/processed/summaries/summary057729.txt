The dramatic landing of the SUV-sized rover is set for 1:31 a.m. ET Monday.
This landing process involves a sky crane and the world's largest supersonic parachute.
Curiosity's first stop slated to be Gale Crater, which may have once contained a lake.
The vehicle will be controlled from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
