Formula One driver Sergio Perez looking forward to his "home" race in Texas on Sunday.
The Mexican is expected to have thousands of fans crossing the border to support him.
He has been one of F1's surprise success stories in only his second season on the grid.
Perez has earned a big-money move to McLaren after three podium placings in 2012.
