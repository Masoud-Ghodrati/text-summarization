Barbra Streisand three-plus hour concert took place at Brooklyn's new Barclay's Center.
She wore a shiny black number that had enough sheer to show off those famous legs.
Streisand powered through "Enough is Enough" and "Don't Rain on My Parade".
Her tribute to composer Marvin Hamlisch, who recently passed away, was extremely touching.
