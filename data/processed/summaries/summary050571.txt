4 Columbia Lil' Cycos gang members are convicted in a federal court in California.
They could face life in prison without parole, a U.S. Attorney's office says.
They used violence and intimidation to extort money from L.A. street drug vendors.
A baby was killed when one such vendor was shot at, for not paying the "rent".
