Kaitlyn Hunt faces 2 felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery in Florida.
She was 18 when she allegedly had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl.
Hunt says it was consensual; the younger teen's parents say they want to protect their child.
Prosecutors offer a plea deal involving community service, probation, but no jail time.
