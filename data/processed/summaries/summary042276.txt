Fred Kaplan: Gore Vidal had huge literary talent, some well used, some wasted.
His satire showed how he prized wit, vision over truth, he says. He loved celebrity.
He says he wrote biography of Vidal, saw his charm, pomposity, inability to love.
Kaplan: Vidal a brilliant essayist, should have stuck to literature, his enduring legacy.
