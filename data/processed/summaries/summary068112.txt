Hans Rosling is a medical doctor and lecturer who spent decades working in Africa.
He became irritated that "developing world" was applied to hugely different nations.
Testing his students at a Stockholm university he found they had preconceived ideas.
He co-founded Gapminder Foundation, which promotes a fact-based world view.
