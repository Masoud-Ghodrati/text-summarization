Musician, composer and record producer Quincy Jones grew up in Seattle.
"Seattle is like a global gumbo, a melting pot with all kinds of people," he says.
Of his work with Michael Jackson, he says: "We went all the way to his soul".
"You have to turn all of your drunken dreams into sober realizations", says Jones.
