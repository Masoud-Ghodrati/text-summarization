NEW: The U.S. and South Korean defense ministers talk by phone, a spokesman says.
Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell will make the trip.
He'll arrive in China, then go to South Korea and Japan.
It is the first such visit since the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.
