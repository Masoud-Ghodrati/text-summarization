Earl Scruggs died Wednesday of natural causes in Nashville, his son told CNN.
Scruggs and Lester Flatt were part of the musical team that made modern bluegrass.
He developed the three-finger style that made the banjo a "front" instrument.
"The Ballad of Jed Clampett" and "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" are signature tunes.
