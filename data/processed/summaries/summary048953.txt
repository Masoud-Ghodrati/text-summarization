Car renting company Hertz has cut costs by 25% in four years, in part by introducing cost-efficient rental kiosks.
Hertz has also launched the world's first global car club, allowing customers to pick up rentals in designated parking lots.
The company has been buffered from economic woes by rising demand for luxury cars in emerging markets.
