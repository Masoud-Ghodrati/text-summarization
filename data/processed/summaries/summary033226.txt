Reviews: The Kindle Fire HD is a good tablet but not the "best at any price".
Consumer Reports gave it a thumbs-up, citing improvements on the original.
Reviewers like screen and physical improvements, such as camera and volume button.
Still, compared to an iPad, the Fire HD is "not there yet," some say.
