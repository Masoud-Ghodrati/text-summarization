Donald Trump's Scottish golf course cost $150 million to create.
Its creation was hugely unpopular with locals and environmental groups.
Golf World magazine has already ranked the course as the eighth best in Britain.
It opens to the public this Sunday and green fees will be same as a round at St. Andrews.
