Global media paid Boko Haram little attention until 200 girls were abducted, says Shehu Sani.
Boko Haram became more violent after its founder was killed in 2009, he says.
At talks in 2011, the group blamed government action for their militancy, Sani says.
He says the use of force to free hostages can be deadly and negotiations must be held.
