NEW: Winfield will receive a bad-conduct discharge.
He is accused of being one of six soldiers who formed a "kill squad".
Winfield originally faced five charges including murdering three Afghan civilians.
Winfield's father said he tried to report the group's alleged actions to the Army but was ignored.
