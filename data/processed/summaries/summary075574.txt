Rush Limbaugh says Pope Francis sounds Marxist for his statements on poverty.
Pope decries the idolatry of money, extreme materialism and disregard for poor.
Limbaugh says remarks "would have been unthinkable for a pope" to say few years ago.
Robert Ellsberg: But concern for the poor above all is not Marxist, it's the core of Catholicism.
