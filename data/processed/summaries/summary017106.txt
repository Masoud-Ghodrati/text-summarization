Sandra Samuel, who saved toddler's life, sees no heroism in her actions.
Why she faced gunfire: "This baby is something very precious to me".
Samuel: "When I hear gunshot, it's not one or 20. It's like a hundred gunshots".
For now, she will stay in Israel helping take care of orphan toddler that she saved.
