Former Egyptian Interior Minister Habib El Adly faces charges of killing protesters.
His new trial date is the same day as ousted President Hosni Mubarak's trial.
Protesters are angry after demanding speedy trials and swift judgments on regime members.
Six of El Adly's former assistants are also accused of killing protesters.
