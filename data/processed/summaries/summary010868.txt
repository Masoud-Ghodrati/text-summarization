Blake Hounshell says Hom is likely to fall as Syria regime continues brutal crackdown.
He says U.S. committed to ousting regime but has not gone all in to end complex conflict.
He lists 6 ways the U.S. faltered, including taking force off the table; worrying about al Qaeda.
Hounshell: There are no good options, only bad and worse; time running short to save lives.
