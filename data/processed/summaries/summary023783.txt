Two soldiers are drinking alcohol while watching a Sunday night football game.
One soldier gets the hiccups; the other uses a gun to try to cure him with a scare.
But Patrick Myers, 27, allegedly uses the gun in "unsafe manner" and shoots other soldier in face.
Myers charged with manslaughter in death of Pfc. Isaac Lawrence Young, 22.
