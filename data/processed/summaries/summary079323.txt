Turkish Deputy PM Ali Bababcan said that Turkey is becoming a "source of inspiration" for many countries.
He says Turkey shows how Islam and democracy can go hand-in-hand.
Bababcan's comments come as Turkey continues to push for European Union membership.
The ambition is questioned by some who point to the country's already strong economy.
