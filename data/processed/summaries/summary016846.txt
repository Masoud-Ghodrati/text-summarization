Bob Greene says Olympics thankfully didn't echo 1960s competition between superpowers.
He says when Soviets, U.S. competed in space race, the goal galvanized Americans.
He says they saw Kennedy's moon goal as repudiation of Khrushchev's "bury you" remark.
Greene: U.S. got there first; today, there's no race, just friendly competition, like in Sochi.
