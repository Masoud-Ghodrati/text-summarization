Michael Schumacher's treatment for a serious head injury is into its seventh month.
A statement in June said the seven-time F1 world champion was "not in a coma anymore".
"It's crazy to realize Michael is still in hospital and still fighting," said Sebastian Vettel.
Neurosurgeon Peter Hamlyn says recovery is "always be a story of years".
