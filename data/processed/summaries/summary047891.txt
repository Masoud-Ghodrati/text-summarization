An animal rights group says it videotaped purported animal abuse at a turkey farm.
Sheriff's investigators launched a search of the farm in North Carolina on Thursday.
The farm is owned by Butterball, authorities in Hoke County say.
Butterball says any employee who violates its "zero tolerance" animal abuse policy will be fired.
