A California homeowner sued police after an officer chased a suspect onto her property.
She says the officer invaded her home without a warrant, but a judge sided with the officer.
On appeal, a federal court found for the homeowner, allowing the lawsuit to proceed.
The U.S. Supreme Court sides with the officer, citing his "qualified immunity".
