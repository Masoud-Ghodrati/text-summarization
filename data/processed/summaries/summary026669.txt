Serena Williams tells CNN how her 2012 season went from disaster to triumph.
The 31-year-old didn't leave the house for two days after first round French Open defeat.
Williams roared back winning Wimbledon, the U.S. Open and two Olympic golds.
Serena says she is in awe of sister Venus, who also had health problems in 2012.
