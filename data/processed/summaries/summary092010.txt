The NAACP and a New York City teachers' union are trying to stop 22 school closures.
The groups want to stop the expansion or co-location of 20 charter schools.
An NAACP official says the plan unfairly favors charters at the expense of regular schools.
But some, like activist Geoffrey Canada, say more charter schools are needed.
