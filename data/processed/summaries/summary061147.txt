Last March, Novespace started selling seats on their "zero-gravity" flights..
Planes that follow a parabolic flight path can mimic the feeling of entering a gravity-free zone..
Tickets cost $7,932 (cheaper than $250,000 for a seat on Virgin Galactic)..
The flights are popular with scientists and astronauts-in-training..
