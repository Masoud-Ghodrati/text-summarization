Mike Huckabee told his TV viewers and emailed his supporters that he was ending his show and considering a 2016 bid.
Huckabee said his presidential consideration put Fox News in a tough position so he decided to halt his program.
Fox News confirmed the announcement Saturday that this evening's show will be Huckabee's last.
