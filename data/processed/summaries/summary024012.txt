248 Lexington, Kentucky, residents will be tattooed with lines from the same poem.
Poet Bianca Spriggs says she crafted the poem as a love letter to Lexington.
The Lexington Tattoo Project is being overseen by two local university professors.
The entire project, which includes a documentary, will be unveiled in the fall.
