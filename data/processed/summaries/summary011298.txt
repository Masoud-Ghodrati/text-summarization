David Wearing: Those to blame for Iraq crisis include ISIS, PM Nouri al-Maliki, Syria's Bashar al-Assad.
Main offenders include former Western leaders who are defending their actions - Wearing.
Cheney, Wolfowitz and Blair have no right to offer advice on how to deal with the crisis, he adds.
Iraq must not endure more U.S. military devastation, Wearing says; it needs political solution.
