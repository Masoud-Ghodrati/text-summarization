Nie Shubin was executed in 1995 -- when he was 20 -- for raping and killing a woman.
His mother is seeking to exonerate him after another man confessed to the same crimes.
Authorities tried Nie Shubin behind closed doors and barred the parents from the courtroom.
Nie told a lawyer hired by his family that he was beaten into a confession on his sixth day in jail.
