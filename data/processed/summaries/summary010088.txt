AOL CEO Tim Armstrong was on a conference call about Patch, the local news network.
"Abel -- put that camera down right now. Abel! You're fired. Out!" he tells an employee.
Abel Lenz, who was Patch's creative director, later tweeted "No comment".
Business Insider: AOL is slashing the number of Patch sites from 900 to 600.
