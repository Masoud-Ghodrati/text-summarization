Michael Hayden: The endgame is approaching for the Syrian regime.
He says bombing of a security meeting killed Assef Shawkat, a key member of regime.
Bashar al-Assad lacks his father's skill or political sense, Hayden says.
He says U.S. should back opposition elements but regime could be replaced by civil war.
