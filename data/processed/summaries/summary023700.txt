Francois Hollande says he is "stupefied and angry" about Jerome Cahuzac's confession.
Cahuzac admitted having an undeclared Swiss bank account after months of denials.
The former budget minister is being investigated for suspected tax evasion.
"Cahuzac did not benefit from any protection," Hollande states.
