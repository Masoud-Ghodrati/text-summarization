David Gergen: Newt Gingrich generated the most buzz at CNN debate.
He says Gingrich, once written off, is now a top-tier contender in the race.
Gergen says his remarks on immigration may win him points, could signal a "new Newt".
But he says Mitt Romney remains the man to beat within the GOP field.
