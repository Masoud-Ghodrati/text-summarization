Baldwin and a businessman sued, alleging Costner had fooled them into selling stock.
Baldwin's attorney, James Cobb, said he was disappointed with the decision.
"They were really smart," Costner said of jurors, " ... they saw the truth of the story".
The oil separation technology was developed in the 1990s by a company created by Costner.
