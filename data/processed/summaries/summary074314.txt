An army crackdown on militants in North Waziristan has killed more than 200 over six days.
At least eight soldiers have died in the fighting.
The military action comes after an airport attack by militants linked to the Taliban.
Roads out of North Waziristan remain sealed off, and a curfew is in effect.
