A Los Angeles County judge says some of the young victims are having nightmares.
Los Angeles elementary teacher Mark Berndt is charged with 23 counts of lewd acts on a child.
The judge rejects a request to reduce Berndt's bail from $23 million to $1 million.
Berndt transferred to another jail after his attorney complains about jailers' harassment.
