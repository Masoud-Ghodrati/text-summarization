The defendant was visa chief at a U.S. consulate in Vietnam.
He allegedly received millions of dollars for approving visas based on false information.
A confidential source tipped the consulate that a visa conspiracy was going on.
Two others -- an American and a Vietnamese -- also are charged in the case.
