Dean Obeidallah: Some popular films have come under attack for being loose with the facts.
He says a film such as "Gravity" is clearly science fiction; no need to fact-check every point.
Only documentary filmmakers are required to be true to the events they depict, he says.
Obeidallah: Relax and enjoy films that take liberties to make story lines more compelling.
