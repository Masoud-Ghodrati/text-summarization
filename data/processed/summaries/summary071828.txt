Human rights activist Wael Abbas posted videos of police torture on YouTube.
He says YouTube suspended his account, citing complaints about material.
YouTube won't comment on individual videos, but says graphic violence not allowed.
Abbas says he's in shock because YouTube deleted videos he'd saved for years.
