Bombings are an indication that terror groups in Iraq are finding space to operate.
Attack came as Iraq's Shiite prime minister orders arrest of Sunni vice-president.
Iraqi officials speak of a new al Qaeda made up of Sunni fighters; U.S. officials say Shiite groups sponsored by Iran are a bigger danger.
Meanwhile the prime minister does not want Iraq to be a proxy battleground for Saudi Arabia and Iran.
