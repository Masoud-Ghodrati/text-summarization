NEW: NATO rejects claims it hit non-military targets near the coastal city of Zlitan Monday.
NATO airstrikes have pounded the city, about 40 km west of rebel-held Misrata, for a week.
"It's continuous bombing, morning day and night," one resident says.
Government minders took reporters to Zlitan Monday to view the damage.
