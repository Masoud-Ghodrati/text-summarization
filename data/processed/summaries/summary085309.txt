South Africans love to cook lots of meat at outdoor barbecues known as "braais".
Popular foods include spicy sausages called "boerewors," lamb chops and "pap".
A cured meat similar to beef jerky known as "biltong" is also popular as a snack.
South Africa has plenty of fresh produce available, so don't be a nervous eater.
