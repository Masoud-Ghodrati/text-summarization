Rory McIlroy will return to the European Tour as a full member next season.
Northern Irishman had played fulltime for his rookie year on PGA Tour in 2010.
The 21-year-old says he misses being at home with his friends and family.
McIlroy is skipping this week's Singapore Open, where Ian Poulter is defending champion.
