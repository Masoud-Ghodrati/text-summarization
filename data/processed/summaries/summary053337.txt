NEW: Shell casings at crime scene matched those on suspect's father's land, police say.
The suspect says he saw "two monsters" and shot them, according to an affidavit.
"We just believe that he happened to be in the area that day," an investigator says.
Sweat became a suspect in this case after being arrested this summer in his girlfriend's death.
