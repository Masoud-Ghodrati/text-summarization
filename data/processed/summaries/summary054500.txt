A U.S. Navy minesweeper got stuck Thursday in a sensitive reef off the Philippines.
It remained there Sunday, with no sailors aboard and its damage still not surveyed.
A U.S. navy official says, " I greatly regret any damage this ... caused the Tubbataha Reef".
The reef, a World Heritage Site, contains threatened and endangered marine species.
