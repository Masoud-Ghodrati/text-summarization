Mitrice Richardson's family has fought to have her death investigated as a murder.
But Los Angeles County authorities don't have any evidence of a homicide.
Richardson's body is exhumed so that the family's private pathologist could investigate.
Richardson disappeared in 2009, and her mummified remains were discovered in 2010.
