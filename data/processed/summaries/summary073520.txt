459 are arrested after violence at the ashram of Rampal Maharaj, police say.
Rampal was arrested Wednesday at the complex in India's northern Haryana state.
Among the new charges against Rampal are sedition, waging war against the state.
Ashram leaders hand over to police six bodies; all apparently died of illness.
