NEW: Strauss-Kahn did well in polls of possible French presidential candidates.
No charges have been filed in the alleged incident.
Police say Strauss-Kahn was naked when he tried to forced himself on a N.Y. hotel employee.
The hotel employee escaped, and police took Strauss-Kahn off a Paris-bound flight.
