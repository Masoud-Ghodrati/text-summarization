Getting lost in the narrow streets of Marrakech's old medina is a great way to find antiques and oddities.
The Jardin Majorelle was created by French painter Jacques Majorelle and later owned by Yves Saint Laurent.
Outside Marrakech, travelers can take a hot air balloon trip, explore the Atlas Mountains or ride a zip wire.
