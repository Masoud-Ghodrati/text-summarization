Todd Graham: Mitt Romney had a bad debate in Iowa, didn't seem to know he's trailing in polls.
He says Romney needed new strategy, but he blew chances to go after front-runner Gingrich.
When other candidates attacked him and Gingrich, Romney failed to differentiate himself.
Graham: Gingrich acted ready to take on Obama; Romney acted as if he were trying not to lose.
