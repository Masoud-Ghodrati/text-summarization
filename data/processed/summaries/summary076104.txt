Samantha King says tumult over Komen funding not a surprise: Foundations are political.
She says Komen has long been rightward leaning, focused on treatment, not causes.
She asks: Group takes funds from chemical companies; does that discourage focus on toxins?.
King: Komen should use loyalty shown in supporters' dismay over funding to redirect priorities.
