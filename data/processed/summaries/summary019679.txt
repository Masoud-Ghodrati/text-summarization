Torpedoes from a German submarine sunk the Danton on March 18, 1917.
The vessel is resting in an upright position about two-thirds of a mile under water.
At 472 feet, the ship was one of the largest French naval vessels of its era.
An unmanned submarine surveying a proposed pipeline route found the ship in 2007.
