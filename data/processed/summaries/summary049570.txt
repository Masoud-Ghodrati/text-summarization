Militant Islamist group has al Qaeda connections and some control of southern Somalia.
Al Shabaab emerged in 2004 and grew when Islamic Courts Union seized Mogadishu.
Organizational ties between group and al Qaeda "central" are thought to be weak.
Some fear that under pressure, Al Shabaab will launch attacks in Kenya and elsewhere.
