Hamid Dabashi: Some are depicting Iran conflict as a battle of middle class vs. poor.
Dabashi: Mir Hossein Moussavi draws support from wider group than middle class.
He says it's wrong to say Mahmoud Ahmadinejad supporters are poor, rural Iranians.
Dabashi says best parallel may be to the U.S. civil rights movement of 1960s.
