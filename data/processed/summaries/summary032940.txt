Investigators examine a camera that was attached to Michael Schumacher's ski helmet.
The former racing driver remains in critical but stable condition, his manager says.
Schumacher suffered severe head injuries in an accident in the French Alps last weekend.
He remains in an induced coma in a hospital in the French city of Grenoble.
