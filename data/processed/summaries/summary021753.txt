A bomber killed at least 15 people in an attack on a religious ceremony, a Shiite cleric says.
After the blast, soldiers shot and killed six people who'd sought refuge, the cleric says.
No one claimed responsibility, but Boko Haram has made attacks in the area before.
The Nigerian military has not responded to a CNN request for comment on the shooting claim.
