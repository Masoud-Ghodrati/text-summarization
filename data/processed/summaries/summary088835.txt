A year ago Thursday, a Supreme Court ruling dismantled Defense of Marriage Act.
Roberta Kaplan argued the case for Edie Windsor on behalf of same-sex marriage.
Kaplan reminded herself "It's all about Edie, stupid," and Edie's 44-year relationship.
Kaplan's amazed at how many states have used Windsor case to pass same-sex marriage.
