Rebels in the capital include the "Tripoli Brigade," consisting of ex-Tripoli residents.
Rebel fighters scatter from Green Square amid fears Gadhafi forces are nearing.
Two of Gadhafi's sons -- Saadi and Saif al-Islam -- are arrested, a rebel official says.
Their father earlier urged Libyans to fight to "lead the people to paradise".
