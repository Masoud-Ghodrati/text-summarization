A Syrian rebel group has been disowned by al Qaeda.
Peter Bergen says al Qaeda's central leadership seems put off by the group's brutality.
The split could weaken al Qaeda's grip in Syria, after it made advances there, he says.
Bergen: U.S. officials believe more Americans have gone to fight vs. the Syrian regime.
