Milan director Umberto Gandini tells CNN the time was right for Mario Balotelli to leave.
Gandini says the controversial striker is not yet at the stage where he can "carry the club".
Balotelli left Milan for Liverpool in August but has had a modest start to life at Anfield.
The 24-year-old has just one goals in eight matches and was recently benched.
