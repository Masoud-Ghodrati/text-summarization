Chief Justice John Roberts and Barack Obama deliver flawless oath ceremony this time.
The pair flubbed the oath at Inaugural in 2009, having to redo it the next day.
Roberts had oath written on card, same as last time, with spacing for pauses.
Obama and Roberts will read the oath again on Monday at Capitol.
