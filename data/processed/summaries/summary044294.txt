John Kiriakou was a CIA intelligence officer from 1990 to 2004.
He is charged with several counts related to illegally disclosing information.
Feds say he identified a CIA employee involved in capturing a top terror suspect.
That suspect was subjected to waterboarding 83 times, a government memo says.
