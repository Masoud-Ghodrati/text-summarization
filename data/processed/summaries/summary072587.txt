India has become a Mecca for foreigners seeking a surrogate mother to gestate their child.
India is one of the few countries that allows commercial surrogacy, where costs are low.
Critics say the practice takes advantage of poor women and is akin to "organ sale".
Surrogates interviewed say the up to U.S.$8,000 received rescues them from a life of poverty.
