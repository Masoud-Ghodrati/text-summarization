Danish newspaper says agent Morten Storm offered to help find al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.
The plot involved finding the cleric a Western wife, putting a tracking device in her suitcase.
The plot was apparently foiled when the woman left the suitcase behind.
Al-Awlaki was later killed in a U.S. drone strike.
