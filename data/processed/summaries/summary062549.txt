Tanzanian-born social activist Rakesh Rajani calls himself "a broker of ideas".
He founded non-profit Twaweza, which means "we can make it happen" in Swahili.
Rajani believes there needs to be a "ground up" movement brought about by locals.
He also says as Africa continues to rise, young people musn't be left behind.
