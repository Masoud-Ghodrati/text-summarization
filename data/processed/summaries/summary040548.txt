NEW: The suspect's brother tells WXIA that his arrest is a "big mistake".
"He's an animal. He killed my little angel," the 7-year-old's mother says.
A neighbor says she shouted at suspect Ryan Brunn as investigators arrested him.
The 20-year-old was a maintenance worker at the apartments, authorities say.
