Samsung has launched its smartwatch which it is calling the Galaxy Gear.
Technology analyst Jeff Kagan says the wireless industry reinvents itself every few years.
The smartwatch will connect and communicate with Galaxy phones and tablets.
So does anyone need it? Kagan says we need to wait and see -- we might be surprised.
