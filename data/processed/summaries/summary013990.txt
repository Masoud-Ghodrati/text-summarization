Carolina Picchio, 14, jumped from a window to her death after bullying on Facebook.
Her sister and friends say they reported the abusive content to Facebook, but nothing happened.
The Novara prosecutor is looking into filing a criminal complaint against Facebook.
Facebook says it encourages reporting of abuse and removes content that breaches its rules.
