Saturday's earthquake was similar to one that struck Chile when Darwin visited.
John van Wyhe says Darwin's theories were shaped in part by the experience of the quake.
He says Darwin observed that the quake elevated the Chilean coastline.
It prompted him to ask how life changed to adapt to a changing world, van Wyhe says.
