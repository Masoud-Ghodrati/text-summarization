Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri has died.
Montazeri was one of several prominent clerics who publicly criticized the presidential elections last June.
Montazeri was once heir apparent to late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
Funeral likely to be cause for concern for authorities in Tehran, one commentator says.
