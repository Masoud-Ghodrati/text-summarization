Achenyo Idachaba returned to Nigeria in 2009 hoping to start a business.
Always interested in the environment, Idachaba noticed an abundance of water hyacinth.
It is a fresh water weed known for clogging waterways, lowering fish populations.
She decided to take the environmental pest and turn it into beautiful handcrafts.
