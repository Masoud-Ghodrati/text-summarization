A ring once owned by 19th century novelist Jane Austen was auctioned last year.
American singer Kelly Clarkson bought the ring, which had sale price of Â£152,450.
The UK government put an export ban on the item due to its historical link to Britain.
The Jane Austen House Museum has successfully raised funds to buy back the ring.
