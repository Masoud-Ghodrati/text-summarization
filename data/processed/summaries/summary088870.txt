DynCorp will pay the U.S. government $7.7 million and The Sandi Group will pay $1 million.
The Justice Department says the payouts are because they overcharged for work in Iraq.
Two whistleblowers, who worked for The Sandi Group, will get part of these payments.
Federal investigators continue to look into other potential false claims in Iraq.
