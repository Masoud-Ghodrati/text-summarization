Hand-written letter from UK National Arhives shows Jimmy Savile's admiration for Margaret Thatcher.
Savile asked Thatcher if the government would consider a grant for the hospital as "goodwill gesture".
National Archives papers also show that the UK's former prime minister was surprised by the invasion of the Falkland Islands.
"It was such a stupid thing to do," Thatcher told a Falklands war review committee.
