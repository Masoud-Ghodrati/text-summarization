Sentencing is met with disgust among Saudi social media users.
Fayhan al-Ghamdi is found guilty of torturing his daughter, a human-rights official says.
"The girl's mother ceded her original request to sentence the father to death," the official says.
The girl suffered broken ribs, a crushed skull, bruising and burns, a hospital says.
