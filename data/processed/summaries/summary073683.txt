Hundreds of millions of people chew betel quids, mostly in Asia.
Research shows that chewing the parcels raises the risk of oral cancer.
Betel quids are parcels of areca nuts and tobacco wrapped in a lime-coated betel leaf.
In Myanmar, they're popular with taxi drivers who use them to stay awake on the roads.
