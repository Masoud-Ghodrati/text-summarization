NEW: "I don't know what went on with me," a mother says after pleading guilty to murder.
Authorities said Shaquan Duley suffocated her sons in a hotel room.
She put their bodies in a car that she put in neutral, sending them into a river, they say.
A prosecutor says there was no plea deal, and Duley will get 30 years to life in prison.
