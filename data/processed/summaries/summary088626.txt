An American government plane picked up Fowle on Tuesday before flying to Guam.
Fowle spoke to CNN in September to ask the U.S. for help.
An official said the U.S. was still working to secure the release of Bae and Miller.
Fowle was arrested in North Korea in May for leaving a bible at a club for foreign sailors.
