The X-ray machine was voted the most significant scientific invention, in a poll by the Science Museum in London.
Out of almost 50,000 votes cast, one in five people selected it as the object they believed it had the greatest impact on the past, present and future.
X-rays were followed by the discoveries of penicillin and the DNA double helix structure.
The public vote  began on 10 June this year as part of the Science Museum's events to mark its centenary.
