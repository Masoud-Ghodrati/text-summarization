NEW: Firefighters were "pretty lucky today," a state spokesman says.
All six new fires reported Sunday are under control, the Texas Forest Service says.
Still, several blazes involving more 130,000 acres are uncontrolled.
The National Weather Services issues "red flag warnings" for parts of six states.
