Two brothers, four and two, died after being swept away by floodwaters during Sandy.
Their mother said she had sought shelter at a nearby house, but was turned away.
The homeowner has said he only saw a man outside, and could not help him.
He said the mother, Glenda Moore, should not have been driving during the storm.
