Southwest has unveiled an improved Rapid Rewards program.
Members can now redeem points on every seat, every day and on every flight.
Earn or use points at least once every 24 months, and you'll keep your points forever.
Southwest's rewards program is now more competitive with those of the legacy carriers.
