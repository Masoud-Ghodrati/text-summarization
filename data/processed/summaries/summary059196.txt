India's general election will take five weeks and is the biggest election in history.
814 million -- more than combined populations of the U.S. and Western Europe -- are eligible to vote.
The race pits a controversial but popular Hindu nationalist against a member of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.
Analysts are describing the vote as India's most significant in decades.
