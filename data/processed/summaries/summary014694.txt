Dean Obeidallah: A growing number of prominent liberals criticize President Obama.
Jackson Browne, Matt Damon, John Cusack are among the critics.
Obeidallah says they gloss over the fact that Obama needs Congress to get things done.
He says critics seem to want a president with dictatorial power to impose his will.
