Actor Ryan O'Neal tells a jury he doesn't want to lose a portrait of Farrah Fawcett.
He and the late actress were an on-again, off-again couple for some 30 years.
Pop artist Andy Warhol painted two nearly identical portraits of Fawcett.
Her alma mater, the University of Texas, has one and is suing O'Neal for the other.
