Tom Cruise remembers Tony Scott as a "creative visionary" and a "dear friend".
Scott left two notes behind, including one to his family, a coroner official says.
"There's nothing to indicate it is anything else" than suicide, he says.
Scott, 68, plummeted from the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro.
