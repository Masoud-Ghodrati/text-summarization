Victoria Falls isn't just about bungee jumping -- it offers rafting, wildlife and river trips.
The falls stretch 1.7 kilometers, on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe.
February and March is when the falls are at their most spectacular.
Elephants, zebras, giraffes and hippos all live in the surrounding parks.
