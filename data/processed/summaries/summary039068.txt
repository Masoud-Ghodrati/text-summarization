The suspected drone fired at least 6 missiles, an official says.
Three militants were wounded and 15 killed, the local official adds.
This is thought to be the third such fatal drone strike in Pakistan's tribal region in 3 days.
The U.S. government has defended such attacks as guided by the laws of war.
