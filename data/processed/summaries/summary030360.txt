NEW: The nuclear plant might have been shaken harder than it was designed to bear.
The casks, each weighing 115 tons, moved between 1 and 4 inches in the quake.
No radiation was released and the casks were not damaged, an official says.
The safety standards for such casks are "unbelievable," an NRC spokesman says.
