Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman, won't likely find a safe job, his lawyer says.
Zimmerman has collected hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Zimmerman's wife faces a perjury charge for allegedly lying about their financial situation.
Zimmerman has sued NBC Universal, but hasn't specified a dollar figure.
