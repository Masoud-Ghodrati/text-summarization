Ruben Navarrette: Californians are fatalistic about high gas prices, and remember 2008.
Even if you take the bus, he says, high gas prices affect the cost of food, other goods.
Navarrette says presidential candidates' promises of lower gas prices are empty rhetoric.
He thinks a good move would be negotiating to buy more oil from Mexico, a friend and ally.
