A man who interviewed witnesses for police describes what they saw in Wisconsin.
He says witnesses say the shooter was a bald, white man with a 9/11 tattoo.
The gunman opened fire in the parking lot then in the temple's holy room, he says.
Those inside sought cover in the pantry, with one woman even hiding in a closet.
