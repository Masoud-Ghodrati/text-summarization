Ankara's mayor has used his Twitter account to accuse a BBC correspondent of spying.
Mayor Ibrahim Melih Gokcek created a hashtag to spread the claims against the journalist.
However, online opponents mobilized their own hashtag in response to Melih Gokcek.
Their hashtag - accusing Melih Gocek of being a provocateur - became more widely spread.
