Toyota reports $2.2 billion profit for fiscal year 2009 that ended on March 31, 2010.
Operating revenue recovers from 2008 losses to profit in 2009, Japanese carmaker says.
2009 sales were up across Asia and Japan, but down in both North America and Europe.
Carmaker has been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year.
