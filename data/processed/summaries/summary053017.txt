NEW: Jim Hall legitimized the guitar as an instrument in jazz, guitarist Julian Lage says.
Hall's guitar had "a really full, nice, round, sweet sound," guitarist Russell Malone says.
"He was the kindest person in the world," his wife says.
He was the first jazz guitarist given the NEA's Jazz Masters award.
