Andy Murray will undergo minor back surgery and most likely miss the rest of 2013.
Murray missed the French Open with a back problem before winning Wimbledon.
He lost early in two U.S. Open warm-up events and was upset in New York by Stan Wawrinka.
Murray is the third member of the 'Big Four' to miss tournaments this year due to a lingering injury.
