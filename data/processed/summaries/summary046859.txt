Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart wants craigslist to cut Erotic Services section.
Dart said that the Web site for 2 years ignored his requests to cut section.
"Craigslist is the single largest source of prostitution in the nation," says Dart.
We help police fight illegal activity "on a daily basis," says craigslist spokeswoman.
