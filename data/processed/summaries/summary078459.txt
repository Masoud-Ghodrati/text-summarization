The Great Wall of China is symbol of national pride and unity.
China struggles with how to manage and protect it as it promotes mass market tourism.
There are rites of passage attached to the Great Wall; one is to sleep  on it.
Those who do should bring food and water to share, a sleeping bag and stories.
