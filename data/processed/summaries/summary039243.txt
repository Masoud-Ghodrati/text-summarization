A discrimination suit was filed by the man who heads ICE operations in New York.
James Hayes claims he was passed over for promotions in favor of less-qualified women.
Hayes cites alleged behavior by Suzanne Barr, chief of staff for the director of ICE.
ICE says the allegations are under review; Barr has taken paid leave of absence.
