Ali Noorani: To see the promise of immigrant ambition, look to the goals of Ivan Rosales.
He says Rosales came illegally as infant to U.S; a college grad, now wants to be oncologist.
He says Rosales can request stay of deportation under new Obama plan Wednesday.
Noorani: Step should be prelude to Congress passing reform that welcomes people like Rosales.
