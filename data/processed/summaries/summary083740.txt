Frank Hatley was jailed last year for falling behind on child support payments.
Hatley had paid for 13 years until he learned boy might not have been his.
DNA test proved child wasn't Hatley's, but court still ordered back payment.
The south Georgia man is cleared from his debt, his attorney announces.
