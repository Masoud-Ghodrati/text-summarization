Chris Brown wanted no part of the confrontation, a source close to the singer says.
Brown and his friends were trying to leave when they were brutally attacked, the source says.
Drake "was on his way out of the club when the altercation began," his rep says.
"No one in Chris' camp was inciting the other party," Brown's spokesman says.
