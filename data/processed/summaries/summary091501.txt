Pakistan's Supreme Court declares amnesty protecting politicians is unconstitutional.
Politicians, including President Asif Ali Zardari, were protected from corruption, criminal charges.
Amnesty, passed in 2007 under then-President Pervez Musharraf, expired last month.
As president, Zardari still has immunity from prosecution.
