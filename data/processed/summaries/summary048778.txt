Sylvia Adcock: Investigators need to look closely at Flight 370's cargo manifest.
Adcock: Malaysian officials said jet was carrying 440 pounds of lithium ion batteries.
Adcock: Lithium ion batteries are flammable, can burn in a way that's difficult to extinguish.
Checking this is at least as important as investigating pilot's flight simulator, she says.
