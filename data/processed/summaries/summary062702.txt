Three soldiers are among 12 service members who brought prostitutes to hotel rooms.
The incident occurred in April ahead of Barack Obama's trip to Colombia for summit.
All three received what military calls "non-judicial punishment".
13 Secret Service agents and three DEA agents were also implicated in the scandal.
