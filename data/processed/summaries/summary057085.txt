Dionne Warwick was the most prolific interpreter of David and Bacharach songs.
"Don't Make Me Over" was the first David-Bacharach hit for Warwick, in November 1962.
"I will always have him with me each time I sing the lyrics written for me by him," Warwick says.
David, 91, died Saturday from complications of a stroke.
