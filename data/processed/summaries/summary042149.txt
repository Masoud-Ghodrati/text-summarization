William Darelle Smith went on trial in 2010 for first-degree murder.
A doctor who did the victim's autopsy testified, then was contacted by a juror.
The trial judge didn't order a hearing into that interaction; high court says he erred.
State Supreme Court orders such a hearing, which could lead to a new trial.
