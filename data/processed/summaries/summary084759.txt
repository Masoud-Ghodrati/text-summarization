David Frum says conservatives are brooding over the loss of the election.
He says some see it as the whites being outnumbered by minorities who want handouts.
Frum: Obama was not re-elected by people who wanted to take but by those who want to work.
Both parties favor social programs to varying degrees, he says, but socialism not in offing.
