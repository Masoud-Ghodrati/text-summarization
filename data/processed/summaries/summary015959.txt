Sen. Tom Coburn: Despite reports, nobody in Congress is debating Oklahoma disaster aid.
Coburn: FEMA has $11.6 billion for assistance, more than enough to help tornado victims.
But if FEMA fund runs out, Coburn will stick by policy to deny aid without cuts elsewhere.
Coburn: I opposed Sandy aid package because it was an "all-you-can-eat buffet".
