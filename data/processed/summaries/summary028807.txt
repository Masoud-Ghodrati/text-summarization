Wreck of the Costa Concordia, one of the largest cruise ships ever built, raised from sea bed.
952-foot ship ran aground in January 2012 on Tuscan island of Giglio, killing 32 passengers.
Unprecedented operation involves more than 500 workers, will cost at least $400 million.
Raising of Concordia is only first phase -- ship must then be dismantled at nearby port.
