EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has joined forces with Lonhro to launch Fastjet.
The low-cost airline will operate from Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Angola.
Low prices will democratize air travel in Africa, say Fastjet executives.
Challenges include airport infrastructure, high taxes and fuel duties.
