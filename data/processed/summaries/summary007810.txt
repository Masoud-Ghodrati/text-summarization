Gonzaga University says students could be kicked out for violating the school's weapons policy.
Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh used a pistol to scare away a convicted felon from their apartment.
The apartment is not on campus but is owned by the university.
In a disciplinary hearing, the students were found guilty of two infractions of school policy, their attorney said.
