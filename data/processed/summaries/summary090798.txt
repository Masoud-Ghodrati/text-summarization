Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurd, was removed from his post, officials say.
His ouster comes as Kurds boycott the government.
Kurds are angered by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's comments linking ISIS to Kurds.
A Kurd official says al-Maliki is trying to create an Arab-Kurd conflict as a diversion.
