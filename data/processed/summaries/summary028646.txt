UK Parliament has voted in favor of Britain joining airstrikes in Iraq.
The UK wants to redeem itself after the Iraq invasion in 2003, writes Lina Khatib.
As it currently stands, the coalition's plan carries a high risk of backfiring, she says.
Khatib argues that airstrikes will not sever people's ties with ISIS.
