1st Lt. Brandon Harker left last year for Afghanistan, leaving his dog with a "good friend".
The dog was gone when he returned; he doesn't know if it was sold or given away.
Harker uses Craigslist to ask for help: "I'd just like him back, safe and sound".
The yellow lab, Oakley, loves to play and snuggle with whomever, whenever.
