The Syrian Electronic Army has claimed an attack on the New York Times website.
The attack is a "serious escalation" in the group's operations, says a researcher.
It's targeting U.S. and European media perceived as hostile to Syria's government, he says.
An attack on the AP Twitter feed caused a flurry of panic and sent stocks plunging.
