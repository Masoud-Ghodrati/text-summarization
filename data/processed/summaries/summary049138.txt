Vinicius Font is the first non-Italian player to be ranked No. 1 in beach tennis.
Last year he helped Brazil to become the first other nation to win world title.
He initially played normal tennis, but took up the beach version in 2008.
Font believes the game is worthy of a future place at the Olympics.
