A UK woman is found dead days after being accused of being a "troll" by Sky News.
Sky confronted her over claims of online attacks against the family of Madeleine McCann.
Madeleine disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Portugal in 2007, aged 3.
British police reopened their investigation into her disappearance in July 2013.
