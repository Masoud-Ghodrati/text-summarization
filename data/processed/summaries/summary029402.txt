Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, appears at a federal court hearing in Los Angeles.
Looking frail with marks on his face, he says he understands the charges he faces.
He wasn't asked to enter a plea; he's set to be back in court later this month.
Ciancia is accused of fatally shooting a TSA officer at Los Angeles' airport.
