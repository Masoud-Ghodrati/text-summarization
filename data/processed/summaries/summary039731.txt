Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is promoting his new business, Square, across North America.
CNN's Maggie Lake caught up with Dorsey in Toronto to hear his plans to upend commerce.
Dorsey said he wants to make commerce frictionless, allowing businesses time to expand.
His comments come as Twitter, which is valued at up to $11 billion, prepares to go public.
