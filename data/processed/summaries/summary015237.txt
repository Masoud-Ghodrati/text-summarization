Carol Hawkins, 49, was the personal assistant to U2's Adam Clayton.
"These were crimes rooted in greed and nothing else," the judge says during sentencing.
"Nothing, frankly, could explain away the scale of this dishonesty," the judge adds.
Hawkins is convicted of 181 counts of theft from Clayton's bank accounts over four years.
