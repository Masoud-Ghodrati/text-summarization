Irish-born screen and stage actor Peter O'Toole died Sunday at the age of 81.
O'Toole was best known for his title role in the 1962 film "Lawrence of Arabia".
Richard Fitzwilliams says O'Toole led a life that was rich in drama and eccentricity.
The talented actor's hellraising lifestyle limited his success, Fitzwilliams says.
