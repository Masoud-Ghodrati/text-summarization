Authorities say Carlos Ortiz was with Aaron Hernandez when they picked up Odin Lloyd.
Lloyd was found killed in an industrial park; Hernandez is charged with murder in case.
Ortiz pleads not guilty on a charge of being an accessory to murder after the fact.
Ortiz's lawyer doesn't contest the $500,000 bail, though he could so later.
