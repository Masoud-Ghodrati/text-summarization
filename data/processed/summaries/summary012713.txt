Stephan Schmidheiny will appeal his sentence in an Italian court, his lawyer says.
Schmidheiny and a Belgian colleague are accused of failing to protect workers from asbestos.
Schmidheiny's lawyer says the sentence will deter other big firms from investing in Italy.
Exposure to asbestos can lead to lung diseases and cancer.
