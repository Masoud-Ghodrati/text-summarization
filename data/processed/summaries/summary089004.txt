Sand sculpture events are serious business; this ain't your childhood sand castle building.
It starts when a "carver" is presented with a 10-ton pyramid of sand to work with.
Many events are not held at beaches, rather under tents or in parks and open spaces.
Event venues include Florida and California, surprising places like Latvia and Denmark.
