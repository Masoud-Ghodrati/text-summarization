Usoni is a futuristic TV production, made in Kenya.
It is set in 2063 and tells the story of European refugees fleeing to Africa.
By then, a string of catastrophes means Africa is the only place where the sun is shining.
Creator Marc Rigaudis wants Usoni to be turned into a TV series, as well as a feature film.
