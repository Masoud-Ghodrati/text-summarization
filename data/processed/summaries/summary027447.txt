A woman in downtown El Paso was struck in the leg by a bullet Tuesday.
El Paso police are treating the incident as if the bullet came from Juarez.
It occurred at about the same time as a shootout between Juarez police and carjackers.
At least four schools in El Paso went into lockdown after reports of the shooting.
