Panama says it found fighter jets, explosives aboard North Korean ship last year.
North Korea has agreed to pay $666,666 for the release of the ship, Panama says.
Most of the ships crew members will also be allowed to leave the country.
The weapons came from Cuba, which said they were going to be repaired in North Korea.
