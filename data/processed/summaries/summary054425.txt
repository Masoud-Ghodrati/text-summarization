The Baha'i faith, founded in Iran, is considered blasphemous there.
Now, 16 Baha'i professors have been arrested for helping followers get advanced degrees.
A government newspaper calls it "a cover for the propagation of the Baha'i faith".
A U.S. agency says Iran "will stop at nothing in its shameless persecution of the Baha'is".
