Ruben Navarrette used to admire Marco Rubio, who challenged Gov. Crist in Florida election.
But, Navarrette says, Rubio's flip-flop on Arizona's immigration law changed his mind.
Rubio opposed the law as racial profiling, now backs amended version, Navarrette says.
Navarrette says amendments are cosmetic at best; Rubio gullible or blinded by ambition.
