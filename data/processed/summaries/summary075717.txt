Dick Clark suffered a heart attack at a hospital in Santa Monica, his publicist says.
Clark hosted "American Bandstand" from 1956 to 1989.
As host of "American Bandstand," Clark bridged racial and political divides.
He was dubbed "America's oldest living teenager" thanks to his youthful appearance.
