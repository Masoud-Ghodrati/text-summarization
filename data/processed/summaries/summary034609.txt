The slain priest was a friend and father figure to many, a parishioner says.
The Rev. Eric Freed was found dead in the rectory of his Eureka, California, church.
Authorities don't have a motive for the killing, Eureka's police chief says.
The suspect, Gary Bullock, had been arrested the previous night for public intoxication.
