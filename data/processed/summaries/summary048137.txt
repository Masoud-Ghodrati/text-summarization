Saudi authorities have begun dismantling a historic Ottoman area of Mecca's Grand Mosque.
A UK-based Saudi historian says the demolition is "cultural vandalism".
Saudi govt says it is expanding mosque to accommodate soaring numbers of Hajj pilgrims.
Historian disagrees, says demolition is fuelled by Saudi religious beliefs.
