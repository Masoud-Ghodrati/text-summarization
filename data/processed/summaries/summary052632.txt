Maj. Doak Weston piloted a B-25 as it went down north of Boston, Massachusetts.
He stayed with the plane until it crashed, avoiding buildings and allowing his crew to bail.
Witnesses and survivors rallied to have Weston's sacrifice honored.
A ceremony was held at the crash site, 65 years to the day after the crash.
