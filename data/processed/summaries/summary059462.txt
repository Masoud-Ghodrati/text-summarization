Police in eastern India report allegations of a new gang rape at the weekend.
Five men accused of raping and killing a woman in December face trial in New Delhi.
Defense lawyers say shifting the case outside Delhi would ensure a fair hearing.
The 23-year-old victim in that case, which transfixed India, died from her injuries.
