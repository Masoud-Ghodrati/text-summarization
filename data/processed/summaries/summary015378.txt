Omar Best, a convicted rapist, was allowed close contact with typist at prison.
Typist, 24, complained about unsupervised access.
Best eventually raped typist and was convicted; the typist filed a federal suit.
"It's an attempt to embarrass the victim," victim's lawyer says of state response to federal suit.
