Researchers have unveiled a 4.4 million-year-old skeleton of a hominid female.
The fossil, nicknamed Ardi, may be the oldest hominid skeleton ever found.
It replaces Lucy, a much-publicized skeleton that dates back about 3 million years.
Scientists: Ardi suggests humans and chimps evolved from a common ancestor.
