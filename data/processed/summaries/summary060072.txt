James Murdoch resigned as the chairman of News International on Wednesday.
Tim Willis: His I-don't-know-nuthin' stance was becoming untenable in the hacking scandal.
Willis: Politicians are happy about the resignation and count it as a victory for the public.
He says the public has far more interest in the death of Davy Jones than Murdoch news.
