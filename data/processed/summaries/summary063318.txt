Peru's tourism minister say Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand were found in the Amazon.
Hand's mother says she won't believe the news until she hears directly from her son.
Family and friends have not been able to reach the couple since January.
Some areas they planned to visit are out of cell phone and Internet reach.
