A Colorado paper reports a grand jury voted to indict JonBenet Ramsey's parents.
The paper cites jurors and an ex-prosecutor, claiming the DA didn't sign the indictment.
The lawyer for Ramsey's father says the "hero" DA averted "a gross miscarriage of justice".
16 years later, there still have been no arrests or charges in the 6-year-old's death.
