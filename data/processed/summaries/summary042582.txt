Giselle Arellano wanted to run for a post as a lawmaker for Mexico's National Action Party.
Candidacy came under fire earlier this month after some accused her of working as an escort.
She says she worked as a model, but never as an escort.
Arellano says she is "not ashamed" of a video showing her scantily clad.
