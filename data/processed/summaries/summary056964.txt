Uruguay is the first country to regulate legal production, sale and consumption of marijuana.
New rules legalizing the marijuana market take effect Tuesday.
President Jose Mujica backed the law and says it will harm drug traffickers.
The law doesn't give foreigners the right to smoke or even buy the drug.
