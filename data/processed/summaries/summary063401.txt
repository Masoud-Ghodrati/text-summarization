Stephen Rakes, 59, is found dead in a Boston-area town.
Rakes recently was dropped from a list of potential witnesses against James "Whitey" Bulger.
He had no obvious signs of trauma; police are investigating, DA's office says.
Rakes had alleged Bulger, a reputed former Boston mob boss, took his store from him.
