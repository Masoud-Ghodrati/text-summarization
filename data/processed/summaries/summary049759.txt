Thousands in Bahrain rip the government for denying a role in boy's death, witnesses say.
One activist says riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and "raided homes".
There was no immediate response from the Bahraini government to the clashes.
Bahrain has been the site of months of anti-government protests and clashes.
