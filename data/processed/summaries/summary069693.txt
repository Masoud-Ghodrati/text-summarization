NEW: Britain acknowledges Kenyan authorities want to talk to its citizens, an official says.
"We believe that terrorists may be in the final stages of planning attacks," Britain says.
It says the attacks may target places where expatriates gather.
Kenyan police, by contrast, say, "We don't believe an attack is imminent".
