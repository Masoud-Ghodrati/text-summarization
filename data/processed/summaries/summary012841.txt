Donal Noonan started the Atlanta Homeward Choir, made up of homeless men.
Noonan's vision: Using his passion for music to show homeless they don't have to be hopeless.
Marvin Coine, one of the first choir members, was offered a job by someone who saw him performing.
Noonan says choir gives members "confidence, self-worth, being part of a community again".
