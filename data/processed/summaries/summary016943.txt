Survivors say they set fire to clothes to try to get help after the boat's engine stopped.
At least 111 people died when a boat capsized off the Italian island of Lampedusa.
Italian authorities estimate that 200 people are still unaccounted for.
"Today is a day of tears," Pope Francis says, as Italy marks a day of mourning.
