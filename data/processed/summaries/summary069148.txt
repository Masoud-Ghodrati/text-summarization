Child cruelty charge downgraded from first to second-degree.
Justin Ross Harris has been charged with murder in the death of his son.
The boy was left in a hot car, strapped to his seat in suburban Atlanta last week.
Investigators say Harris returned to his car hours before he said he found his son.
