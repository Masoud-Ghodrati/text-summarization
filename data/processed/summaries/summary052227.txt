A federal judge says Shannon Richardson isn't a danger to the community.
But the judge says "no conditions will ensure her appearance" again in court.
She's pleaded not guilty to sending ricin-tainted letters to Obama and NYC mayor.
Richardson has had minor roles in TV series including "The Walking Dead".
