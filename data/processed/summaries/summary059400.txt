McClain Hermes, 13, is legally blind but still collects thousands of shoes for less fortunate..
McClain thought footwear would be better off donated than recycled.
Shoes for the Souls began in 2009 and has collected around 10,000 pairs.
Her family says she is selfless and very rarely dwells on her handicap.
