Todd Graham: Candidates had many areas of agreement in third presidential debate.
He says agreeing is a good strategy to build credibility in debate; Romney missed chance.
When Romney was asked about paying for $2 trillion in military spending, he dodged, he says.
Graham: It let Obama deliver a line that would stick; made Romney seem naive on spending.
