Survey: Nearly half of women would forgo sex rather than give up Internet access.
More women than men would be willing to give up sex, the survey found.
The survey, commissioned by Intel, queried 2,119 adults in the U.S. last month.
Most adults also would forgo two weeks of TV over one week of Internet use.
