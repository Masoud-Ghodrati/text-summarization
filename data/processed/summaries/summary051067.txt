Camerawoman Cynde Strand had spent night after night in Tiananmen Square.
As troops arrived, she "got everybody together and said, okay, this is it".
"Bullets were whizzing overhead ... then they turned the lights off".
She and soundman Kit Swartz stayed in the square for the entire historic night.
