Police found more than 1,000 important documents in Paolo Gabriele's possession.
Among them were original documents signed by Pope Benedict XVI.
Many newspaper clippings and printouts touched on religious and spiritual topics.
Gabriele says he is innocent of aggravated theft charge but abused the pope's trust.
