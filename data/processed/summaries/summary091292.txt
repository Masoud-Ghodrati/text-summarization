United Nations agency report says 2011 saw new high for levels of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere.
Levels of carbon dioxide now stand at 390.9 parts per million, up 2 ppm on previous year.
375 billion tons of carbon dioxide released into atmosphere since 1750, say WMO.
Natural carbon sinks are already showing signs of stress and cannot be relied on in future.
