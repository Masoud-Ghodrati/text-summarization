Greek state hopes to sell its stake in the site of the old Athens airport to private developers.
The vast plot of land is expected to host new commercial and residential space.
Proponents say Hellinikon could create 35,000 new jobs in construction alone.
Others warn against selling off state assets to private developers on the cheap.
