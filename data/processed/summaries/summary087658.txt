Chimpanzee mauled and blinded a Connecticut woman earlier this year.
Owner was not aware of the risk the chimpanzee posed, state's attorney says.
Criminal prosecution would have had to determine that owner acted recklessly.
In March, Charla Nash filed a lawsuit seeking $50 million in damages from the owner.
