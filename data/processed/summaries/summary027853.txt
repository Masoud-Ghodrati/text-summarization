Maria Sharapova and Li Na won't be competing in the new IPTL, their agent says.
Sharapova is arguably the biggest name in women's tennis and Li is hugely popular in Asia.
The IPTL is hoping to be as successful as cricket's established IPL.
The official player list is expected to be revealed on Friday.
