French racing authority bans Frankie Dettori for six months over positive drug test.
Jockey accepts the decision and vows to rebuild his reputation when he returns.
Father of five regrets having let down his family and fans, Dettori's lawyer says.
He will have to undergo further testing before he can start racing again in May.
