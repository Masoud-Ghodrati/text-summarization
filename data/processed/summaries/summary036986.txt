3-month-old Afreen Farooq died of cardiac arrest after convulsions, a doctor says.
Her father, already in custody, will be charged with murder, police say.
Police say the father has confessed to beating the little girl because he wanted a son.
The case highlights the preference among many Indians for sons over daughters.
