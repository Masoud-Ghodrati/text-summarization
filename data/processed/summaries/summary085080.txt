René González spent years in U.S. prisons after being convicted in 2001.
He was a member of the so-called "Cuban Five" network of Cuban agents.
Now back in Havana, he has renounced his U.S. citizenship as a U.S. judge required.
"I am a soldier for the Cuban revolution," González declares at a news conference.
