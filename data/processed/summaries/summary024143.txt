Sam Lutfi was ousted from Spears' life when her dad became her conservator.
Lutfi is suing for millions in damages and pay he says he's owed for being Spears' manager.
A book by Spears' mom painted Lutfi as a "predator" and a "Svengali," his suit says.
The Spears book caused him "hatred, contempt, ridicule and obloquy," Lutfi claims.
