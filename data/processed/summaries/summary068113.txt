Paul Warner Powell did not make a last statement at the electrocution.
Powell rejected lethal injection, the state's usual method of execution.
Killer wrote a taunting, profanity-filled letter laying out details of the crime.
Based on letter, prosecutors put Powell on trial for second time in Stacie Reed's death.
