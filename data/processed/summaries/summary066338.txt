Attorney Benjamin Crump says the newspaper has been biased in its quest for records.
Crump says the St. Louis Post-Dispatch hasn't dug into Officer Darren Wilson's past.
But it has chased Michael Brown's juvenile records, he says.
He accuses the newspaper of pursuing "gossip and racist speculation".
