Protesters ask troops to take control of an Islamist group's HQ, a general says.
"I am sorry, America... This is the real Libya," a protester in Benghazi says.
Hundreds take over the Ansar al-Sharia group's headquarters without firing a shot.
That group is tied to an attack last week that left 4 Americans dead.
