NEW: Mubarak arrives at a military hospital for house arrest, state media says.
Another top Muslim Brotherhood official is arrested.
Analyst Robin Wright says Mubarak's pending release is an "extraordinary development".
He was convicted in the deaths of numerous protesters but was granted a retrial this year.
