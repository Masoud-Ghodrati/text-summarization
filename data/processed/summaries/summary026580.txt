Australian government announces plan to create world's largest marine reserve.
The Coral Sea, which includes the Great Barrier Reef, lies off northeast of Australia.
Nearly one million square kilometers of sea will be protected under the plan.
Critics argue that plan doesn't protect species-rich western half of Coral Sea.
