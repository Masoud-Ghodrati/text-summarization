NEW: California action won't affect upcoming Belmont Stakes, New York official says.
Doug O'Neill trained Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner I'll Have Another.
California's state racing board suspended him for 45 days effective July 1 at earliest.
O'Neill was cleared of "milkshaking" but hit for high carbon dioxide levels in his horse's blood.
