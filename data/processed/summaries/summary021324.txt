Murder suspect Bullock was on probation when he was arrested for public intoxication.
He pleaded guilty to cocaine possession tied to a 2012 arrest, got three years probation.
It wasn't the type of probation that should have kept him detained, lieutenant says.
Authorities say Bullock killed a California priest hours after his release from jail.
