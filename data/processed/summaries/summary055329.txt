John Oliver's "Last Week Tonight" used dogs to illustrate the court's public sessions, which are closed to cameras.
Dogs were robed to represent each justice on the court while audio from the hearing played in the background.
Justice Ruth Ginsberg called the video "hilarious".
Gingsberg is also a fan of a Tumblr page that sells "Notorious RBG" shirts.
