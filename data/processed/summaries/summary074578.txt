Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich refuses to abandon her Everest climb after 16 killed in mountain tragedy.
Disaster prompted concerns over conditions on mountain and calls for an early end to climbing season.
Some Sherpas complained over pay and a lack of respect for their traditions and towards those who died.
Weidlich says her solo attempt on Lhotse peak had the backing of Sherpas who she says treated her well.
