EU Commissioner Olli Rehn says UK need not "threaten" to leave European Union.
Rehn: "It is only to the mutual benefit of Britain and Europe that Britain stays as a member".
UK Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum on membership.
Rehn said threat of the breakup of the euro "has all but disappeared".
