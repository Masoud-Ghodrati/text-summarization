Ruben Navarrette notes Rahm Emanuel may run for Chicago mayor.
Immigration reformers there may be unimpressed with his past obstruction on issue, he says.
If Rep. Gutierrez, immigration reform supporter, also decides to run, expect fireworks.
Navarrette: Emanuel didn't lead on immigration; his boss, the president, also derelict on issue.
