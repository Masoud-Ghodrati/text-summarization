Virginia police meet with Jeffrey Easley and the girl he allegedly abducted.
They also went to the San Francisco supermarket where the two were found.
The girl and suspect were soliciting money outside the California store Friday.
Easley is a "very good suspect" in the death of Tina Smith, the girl's mother, police say.
