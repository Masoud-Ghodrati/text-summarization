Mohamed Osman Mohamud said he wanted people to leave the lighting "dead or injured," an affidavit says.
A jury convicts Mohamud, 21, of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction.
He was arrested in 2010 for allegedly trying to bomb a Portland tree lighting.
Authorities tied Mohamud to several alleged terrorists, said he wanted to be part of "jihad".
