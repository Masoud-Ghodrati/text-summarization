Roberto Mancini has suggested Manchester City could move for striker Sergio Aguero.
But Mancini said any move for the 23-year-old could depend on Carlos Tevez.
Tevez is currently the subject of negotiations between City and Corinthians.
Goalkeeper Shay Given has completed his move to Aston Villa on a five-year deal.
