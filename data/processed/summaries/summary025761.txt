George Tiller was one of few remaining doctors in U.S. offering late-term abortions.
He had been shot in 1993 and lived under the constant threat of violence.
He made mark on confirmation process for head of health and human services.
"Third-trimester abortion is simply a part of abortion," Tiller said in 1999.
