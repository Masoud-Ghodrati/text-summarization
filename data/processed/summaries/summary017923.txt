Nine men are jailed in London after admitting a string of terror offenses.
"Their actions could have resulted in serious casualties or fatalities," an official says.
The men were based in three cities: London, Stoke-on-Trent and Cardiff.
They were arrested after a huge covert operation in 2010, police said.
