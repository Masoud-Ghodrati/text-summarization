A Saudi court has sentenced a man to be paralyzed if he can't pay compensation, media say.
The man stabbed and paralyzed his friend 10 years ago, the Saudi Gazette says.
Amnesty International says the reported sentence would be torture if carried out.
The Saudi Justice Ministry has not responded to requests for comment on the case.
