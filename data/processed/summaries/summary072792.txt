The FDA says it's received reports of thousands of pets getting sick.
Official: "This is one of the most elusive and mysterious outbreaks we've encountered".
Sick pets mostly ate a chicken jerky or duck jerky treat or a jerky-wrapped treat.
The FDA says most of the treats involved were made in China.
