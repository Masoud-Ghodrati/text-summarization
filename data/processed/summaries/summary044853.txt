NEW: Israel plans to release 26 Palestinian prisoners over the next two days.
Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Jerusalem and Ramallah on January 1.
Next week's trip will be Kerry's ninth trip to the region.
He kicked off peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians in July, but in November, both sides dug in and passed around blame.
