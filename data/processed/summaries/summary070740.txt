The painting has been identified as a van Gogh after "extensive research," a museum says.
"A discovery of this magnitude has never before occurred," the Van Gogh Museum says.
The picture is from 1888, during a period considered by many to be the high point of his career.
It depicts a landscape in the south of France, where van Gogh was working at the time.
