German journalist and author Juergen Todenhoefer journeyed deep into ISIS territory.
He interviewed ISIS fighters, prisoners, and members of the public caught up in the battle for Iraq and Syria.
One ISIS spokesman told Todenhofer: "slavery and beheadings [are] part of our religion".
ISIS "preparing the largest religious cleansing campaign the world has ever seen," says Todenhoefer.
