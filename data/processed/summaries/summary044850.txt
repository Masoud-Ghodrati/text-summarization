Trainer Jeff Foster is working to release two dolphins into the wild.
Two years ago, the dolphins were the main attraction at a run-down Turkish tourist park.
Foster worked to help release Keiko, the orca from the 1993 movie "Free Willy".
Popular "swim with dolphin" parks in Turkey are a concern to animal welfare advocates.
