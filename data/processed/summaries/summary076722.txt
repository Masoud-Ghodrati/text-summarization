Barber was cutting hair on Friday when Sandy Hook massacre happened.
The killer, Adam Lanza, had come to him for haircuts since he was about 12.
Lanza's mother would bring her son in, but the cuts stopped after five years.
Barber said Lanza's behavior was odd, but he never thought he'd turn violent.
