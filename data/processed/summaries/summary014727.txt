David Frum: It's possible no candidate could reach delegate total to claim nomination.
He says an open convention wouldn't follow historical pattern.
Media spotlight and indepedent-minded delegates could sway the outcome, he says.
Frum says Mitt Romney might be forced to take positions unpopular in general election.
