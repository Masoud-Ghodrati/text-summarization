QPR midfielder Joey Barton is banned for 12 matches by English Football Association.
Barton was sent off on the final day of the Premier League season against Manchester City.
The 29-year-old then kneed Sergio Aguero and appeared to headbutt Vincent Kompany.
Barton's ban means he won't be able to play for QPR again until November.
