Greece hands over the Olympic flame to Russia ahead of Sochi 2014 Winter Games.
The torch will begin an epic journey on Monday, even going into outer space.
It will cover 65,000 kilometers and be carried by 14,000 torchbearers.
Russia hopes 90% of its population will in some way experience the relay.
