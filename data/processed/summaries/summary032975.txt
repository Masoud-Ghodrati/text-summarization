NEW: Tabloids "stand behind the reporting and articles at issue in Mr. Cruise's action".
"I have in no way cut Suri out of my life," the actor says in a sworn statement.
Suri "is a very happy child, and we have a wonderful relationship," Cruise says.
Cruise is suing tabloids for defamation over "abandoned" headlines.
