For Al-Shabaab, the mall was an attractive target because Westerners frequented it.
Also, it fits with the Somalia-based terrorist group's enmity with Kenya.
The group has recruited around 40 American men and also dozens from Europe.
The attack on the Nairobi mall may be an attempt by Al-Shabaab to signal its continued relevance.
