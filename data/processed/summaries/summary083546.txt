Government: There are at least 682 hunger strikers in at least 67 prisons across Turkey.
Opposition says some prisoners are in critical condition, but government disputes that.
Strikers call for use of alternate language in courts and schools, seek freedom for activist.
Turkey's prime minister has shown little sympathy for the hunger strikers.
