Avigdor Liberman was sworn in as Israel's foreign minister again on Monday.
On November 6, a court acquitted him of breach of trust and fraud charges.
Liberman had resigned as foreign minister in December 2012 to face the charges.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held the position open for Liberman's return.
