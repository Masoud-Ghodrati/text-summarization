NEW: The leak of radioactive water into the Pacific has been stopped.
More than 5,700 tons of less radioactive water have been purposefully released so far.
Radiation levels drop sharply offshore, but are many times over the legal limit.
Water in a pit that's leaking into the sea had radiation 7.5 million times above the norm.
