The Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp is just 6 miles from central Damascus.
At least 44 people have died from a lack of food and medical supplies there, activists say.
Civil war fighting has cut off aid to the camp since November.
Palestinian refugee status makes travel very difficult for camp residents.
