NEW: Military council says choice is El-Sisi's, but it highly encourages his candidacy.
Field Marshal Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi is expected to announce soon whether he'll run.
The army chief was defense minister when the military ousted President Morsy last year.
Candidates can officially declare themselves next month.
