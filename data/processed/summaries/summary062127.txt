Arenas charged with one count of carrying pistol without a license in locker room incident.
It is unclear when Arenas, who has been suspended from NBA, will be arraigned on charge.
Arenas has described incident as "misguided effort to play a joke on a teammate".
Arenas said he told authorities that he stored guns in locker to keep them away from his kids.
