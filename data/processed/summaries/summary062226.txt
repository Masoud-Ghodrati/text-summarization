NEW: DA doesn't expect statute of limitation to be a problem in prosecuting case  Bail set for Phllip Garrido but "parole hold" means he can't be released.
Attorney for his wife, Nancy, says she doesn't contest her no-bond status.
Garridos face 29 felony counts in case of Jaycee Dugard, abducted in 1991.
