NEW: Other unions' members plan to support ferry workers, among other May Day activities.
A Bay Area transit agency says ferries won't run from Marin County early Tuesday.
It's due to fears that an expected union action will negatively affect service.
The union is urging members to participate in a "rally" on the Golden Gate Bridge.
