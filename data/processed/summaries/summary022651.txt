Anne M. Mahlum founded Back on My Feet to help the homeless in Philadelphia.
Back on My Feet works with 29 homeless shelters and has more than 400 active members.
Mahlum: Participation must be voluntary for people to make real changes in their lives.
People have a desire to be recognized, valued, appreciated, loved and cared for, she says.
