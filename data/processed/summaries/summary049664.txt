NEW: The government did not seek new powers to shut down social media networks, it says.
Home Secretary Theresa May called a meeting with social media representatives and police after riots.
The government is considering "whether and how we should be able to stop people" from using sites like Twitter.
Two men were imprisoned last week for using Facebook to urge riots.
