Previously unknown work by Diego Velazquez sells at auction in London for $4.7m.
Painting was previously thought to have been by British artist Matthew Shepperson.
Portrait was among a series of paintings put up for sale by Shepperson's descendants.
Change of attribution meant it sold for 10,000 times its original estimate.
