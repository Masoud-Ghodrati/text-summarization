Adam Mansbach turned his frustration with an unsleepy toddler into a funny book.
Written like a children's book, the verses have an adult twist to them.
Title is "Go the F**k to Sleep," and the book is soaring on Amazon before publication.
It's described as a book for inconsolable, tired parents of toddlers who won't sleep.
