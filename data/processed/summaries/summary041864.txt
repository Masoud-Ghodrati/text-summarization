The Rev. Donald Cozzens: Celibacy is 1,000 years old but not intrinsic to the church.
Many popes were married in the first millennium of the church, Cozzens says.
Cozzens says church views marriage as sacred; why should priests be denied it?.
Cozzens: Celibacy is a gift that should be optional, not mandated by the church.
