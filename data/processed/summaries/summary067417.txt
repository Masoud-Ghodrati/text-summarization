Pat and Wally Kutteles have worked 10 years to repeal "don't ask, don't tell".
Their son, Pfc. Barry Winchell, was beaten to death with a bat as he slept.
He went through constant, vicious harassment after rumors he was gay, they write.
They believe DADT prevented him from reporting harassment to superiors.
