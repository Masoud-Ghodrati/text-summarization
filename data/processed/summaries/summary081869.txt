Eurostar, the high-speed train company, is undergoing a massive overhaul.
With Nicolas Petrovic as its chief executive, it is trying to establish new routes.
Petrovic says someday, travelers will think of train travel the same way they think of air travel.
Eurostar faces future competition from Deutsche Bahn for travel through the Channel Tunnel.
