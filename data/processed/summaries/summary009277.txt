Barbara Risman: "Mommy wars" are cooked up by politicians and media, not everyday women.
She says women know well the conflicts society presents them over value of their work.
She says women told job of mothering is valued, so why don't dads make it a "career?".
Women face discrimination over mother choices, Risman says; workplaces must catch up.
