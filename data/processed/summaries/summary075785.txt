Argentina's drug administration has fined the company and two doctors nearly $240,000.
A medical group accuses GlaxoSmithKline of misleading trial participants.
The drug company denies those accusations and says it will appeal the fine.
GlaxoSmithKline says there were no irregularities regarding consent or the vaccine's safety.
