NEW: Egypt may issue a state of emergency if the unrest continues, a minister says.
At least 30 people are killed in clashes near a Port Said prison, officials tell state news.
The violence erupts after 21 are sentenced to death for their part in a deadly soccer riot.
Political unrest has also played a role in a recent violence, including seven deaths Friday.
