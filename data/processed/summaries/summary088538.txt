A defunct shipyard in the city of Malmo, Sweden, has been transformed into a green, sustainable district.
The Bo01 project created a residence where 100 percent of energy comes from renewable sources.
Food waste is converted into biogas for use in local buses.
The project didn't meet all goals but has set an example now used in eco-projects in other parts of the world.
