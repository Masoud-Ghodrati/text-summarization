Father Nick Crews wrote a scathing e-mail to his children about their failings.
When the e-mail became public, many people praised Crews for his bravery and honesty.
Others said he was too harsh and a parent should never speak to children so viciously.
CNN's Ronni Berke said that though the letter was harsh, parents could learn from it.
