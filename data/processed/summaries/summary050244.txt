Vogue contributing editor Andre Leon Talley has curated a new exhibit of little black dresses.
The dresses are imbued with Talley's memories and interpretations.
The collection's 81 dresses represent glamour and practicality, Talley said.
The wearer of a little black dress can infuse meaning into the fabric, Talley said.
