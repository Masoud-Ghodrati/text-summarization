Turkey's minister says Israel is not reciprocating his nation's efforts to remedy relations.
The row began after Israeli forces killed nine Turkish activists on an aid flotilla.
He says "an apology" is needed for Turkey's "friendship" with Israel to continue.
Israel has said that its troops used force only after they were attacked themselves.
