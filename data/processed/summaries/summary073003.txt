Hong Kong group CLSA has released its Feng Shui Index for 2013.
It is going to be a great year for people born in the Year of the Rooster, Dogs or Ox (Cow).
If you are a Pig, Goat (Sheep), Tiger or Snake, it's best to fast forward to 2014.
The past five years of the Snake have been marked by inauspicious events.
