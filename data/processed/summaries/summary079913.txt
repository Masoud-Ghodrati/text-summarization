Ayman al-Zawahiri, the new al Qaeda leader, praises the Arab Spring in an audio address.
A video message from Osama bin Laden, recorded before his death, is also included.
The video is apparently one that was released by U.S. officials without audio in May.
It was seized from bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
