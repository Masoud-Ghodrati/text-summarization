Pervez Musharraf faces five treason charges, including imposing emergency rule in 2007.
The former army chief, who ruled until 2008, pleaded not guilty to all five.
Musharraf says he took action to stabilize the country and fight rising Islamist extremism.
High treason carries the death penalty or life imprisonment.
