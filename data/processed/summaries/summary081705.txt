CNN Beijing bureau chief Jaime FlorCruz was a TIME correspondent in Beijing in 1989.
25 years ago he received a 2 a.m. phone call informing him of a student march on Tiananmen.
He followed the students on their march, inspired by the death of a sacked Party chief.
He had little notion that what would unfold would shake China and grip the world's attention.
