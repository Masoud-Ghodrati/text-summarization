Around 100,000 people in the typhoon devastated region of the Philippines live in tents.
The city of Tacloban is slowly rebuilding with government plans for 200,000 homes for 1 million residents.
Many complain that reconstruction is too slow and homes are being rebuilt on at-risk areas.
"Stand up Tacloban" is the city's new slogan but the region is bracing itself for the new typhoon season.
