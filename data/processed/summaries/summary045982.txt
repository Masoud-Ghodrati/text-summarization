Michael Todd Wolfe, a.k.a. "Faruq," pleads guilty to attempted material support to terrorists.
He was planned to "engage in violent jihad in Syria," a federal prosecutor says.
Wolfe, who is from Austin, was arrested on June 17 at a Houston airport.
A second Austin-area man is being held on separate terror support charges.
