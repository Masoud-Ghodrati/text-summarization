Former archbishop of York is accused of not alerting police to child abuse by a clergyman.
The former archbishop, David Hope, says he followed church policy as it was at the time.
The alleged abuses were committed by Robert Waddington, who died in 2003.
The claims emerged in an investigation by the Times of London and The Australian.
