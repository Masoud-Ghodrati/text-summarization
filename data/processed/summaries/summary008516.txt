China has executed a mining tycoon found guilty of murder and running a "mafia-style" organization.
Liu Han, 48, the former chairman of Hanlong Group, was executed along with his brother, Liu Wei, and three associates.
He was linked to former security czar Zhou Yongkang - the most senior official snared in China's anti-corruption campaign.
