Jeff Pearlman lived in a town with few Jews, and had to sing in the school's holiday concert.
The Christmas carols evoked either Christ or the Virgin Mary or Christ and the Virgin Mary.
"Jeffie" complained to his teacher and Dad that Christmas and concert weren't fair.
His dad said enjoy it, take in the lights, and be happy you don't have to experience the anxiety.
