Al-Shabaab chief Mukhtar Abu Zubayr has a reputation for being secretive, merciless.
Zubayr wants his group to be able to deliver devastating attacks beyond Somalia.
He formally declared Al-Shabaab an affiliate of al Qaeda.
Zubayr's tactics have led to dissent in his group, which he has ruthlessly suppressed.
