"Sofia the First: Once Upon A Princess" has received backlash as well as support.
"It's sort of a matter-of-fact situation rather than an overt thing," a Disney official says.
Some Latinos applauded Disney's new milestone on Twitter.
Disney's decision to not emphasize Sofia's ethnicity has received criticism too.
