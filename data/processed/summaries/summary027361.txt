Museums director Qais Hussain Rashid says ISIS militants are destroying antiquities.
He says they sell parts of ancient carvings to criminals and antique dealers.
ISIS controls Mosul and the ancient city of Hatra, known for its palaces, temples and statues.
"I'm afraid they'll do something crazy there," Rashid says of ISIS fighters in Hatra.
