David Perry: Pope Francis has not called for any new doctrines or changed anything.
Perry: Francis' impact comes from his behavior and words, not his executive power as Pope.
He says that the pope can seem so transformative is a testament to the power of his reform.
Perry: When will the rest of the Catholic Church hierarchy catch up to Francis' revolution?.
