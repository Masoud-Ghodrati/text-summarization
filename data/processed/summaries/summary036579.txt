NEW: Obama calls Kagan "one of the country's leading legal minds.".
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved Kagan's nomination, moving it to the full Senate.
Democrats say Kagan will be a fair judge, while Republicans call her a political activist.
If confirmed, Kagan will be the 112th Supreme Court justice and the fourth woman on the high court.
