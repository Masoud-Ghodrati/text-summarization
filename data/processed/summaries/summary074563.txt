A lawyer offers his NYC loft in lieu of a $2 million bail so Anna Gristina can get out of jail.
A hearing will be held Thursday to consider that proposal.
Gristina, 44, is accused of running an escort service for high-powered clientele.
Her two legal representatives are at odds during Monday's hearing.
