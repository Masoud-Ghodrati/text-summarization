Michelle Knight says Ariel Castro had "a fascination" with fellow captive Amanda Berry.
She calls her defiance of Castro a source of pride; "it felt good to stand up for myself".
Castro had a gun with him "everywhere," threatened her if Berry's newborn didn't live.
Knight coped by talking with a fellow captive, writing to her son, taking solace in being alive.
