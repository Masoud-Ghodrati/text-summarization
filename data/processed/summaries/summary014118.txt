Gene Seymour: What did Golden Globes show? Actress + drinking = interesting speech.
He says Blanchett, Bissett livened things up with frank remarks; hosts had less to do.
He says even with two best picture awards, Globes are flawed predictor of Oscar winners.
Seymour: Globes mostly flashy kickoff of awards season; critic awards better predictor.
