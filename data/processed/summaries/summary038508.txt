The Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather fight is in doubt over the timing of a pre-match blood test.
Golden Boy Promotions chief executive Richard Schaefer claims Filipino Pacquiao is refusing a test 30 days before the bout.
Mayweather called on Filipino to undergo the test to ensure a fair fight.
Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum says the "plug has been pulled" on the fight.
