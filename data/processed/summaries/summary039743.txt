Google Lunar X Prize goes to the first team that can land a rover on the moon by 2012.
Rover must travel on the lunar surface for at least 500 meters, send back images.
There are 13 teams officially competing in the race; number is expected to grow.
The mission will probably cost much more than the $20 million first prize.
