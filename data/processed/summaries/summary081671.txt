A water-cooled transportable solar power station tracks the sun like a sunflower to produce off-grid energy.
The unit can provide 12kW of power and 20kW of thermal power from just 10 hours of sunlight.
The manufacturer says the integrated technology could have great potential in remote communities.
Japan, where fossil fuel prices are high, has expressed an interest in deploying the solar harvester.
