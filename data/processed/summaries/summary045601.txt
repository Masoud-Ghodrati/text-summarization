To the "gates" of political lore, add one for NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio: pizzagate.
The new mayor was photographed chowing down in a pizzeria, using a knife and fork.
Now the pizzeria owner wants to auction the infamous fork for charity.
De Blasio's office is all for it: "We hope they include the knife to raise even more funds".
