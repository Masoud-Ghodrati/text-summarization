A Pennsylvania school suspends a kindergarten girl for making a "terroristic threat".
Her lawyer says she playfully talked of "shooting" a Hello Kitty bubble gun with friends.
The school later reduces the suspension, but still finds she made a "threat to harm others".
A counselor says the girl has no risk factors for violence and had no "harmful ... intent".
