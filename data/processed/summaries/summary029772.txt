U.S. sprinter Tyson Gay is hoping to prove a point at the 2012 London Olympics.
The 2007 triple world champion missed the Beijing 100 meter final after struggling with injury.
He is hoping to prevent Jamaica's world record-holder Usain Bolt defending his three titles.
Gay says he wants to be remembered as a clean runner, "someone who ran with his heart".
