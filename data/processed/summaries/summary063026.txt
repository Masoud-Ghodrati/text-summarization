Startup MakerBot on Friday unveils a desktop device that can scan small 3-D objects.
The resulting digital file can then be used to print a 3-D replica of the object.
MakerBot CEO Bre Pettis: "There's a renaissance going on (in 3-D printing) now".
Pettis was speaking Friday at the South by Southwest Interactive festival.
