More radioactive material than thought was released in days after disaster, TEPCO says.
TEPCO estimates about 900,000 terabecquerels of radioactive materials were released.
A WHO report on people's exposure to radiation following the disaster gives a mixed picture.
Some infants were exposed to high radiation doses but levels were low in most of Japan.
