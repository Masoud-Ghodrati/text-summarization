Texas man was inexplicably drunk without ingesting alcohol, case study says.
His wife started giving him breathalyzer tests; he would register as high as 0.40.
Observation by doctors showed that a yeast overgrowth in his gut fermented food, made alcohol.
The condition is called gut fermentation syndrome and is fairly rare, authors say.
