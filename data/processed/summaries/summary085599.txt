Murder suspect Enock Nsubuga was arrested Wednesday.
Ugandan police say he confessed to killing activist David Kato in a botched robbery.
Police chief claims killing isn't hate crime, blasts reports for fueling aggression against gays.
Kato said he felt threatened, especially after a 2010 article with the banner "Hang Them".
