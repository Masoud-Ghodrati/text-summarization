Two Sri Lankan human rights activists held under anti-terror laws have been released.
Their arrests were condemned by the U.S., UK and international rights groups.
Police say they were held after visiting addresses of interest in connection to a police shooting.
One of the men believes the arrests are linked to a push to condemn Sri Lanka at the U.N..
