"The Last Beekeeper" documentary premieres Saturday on the Planet Green channel.
Filmmakers follow beekeepers from South Carolina, Montana, and Washington.
The film was inspired by headlines about the global disappearance of honeybees.
One of every three bites of food we eat may be pollinated by honeybees.
