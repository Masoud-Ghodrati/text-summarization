Oprah Winfrey says she's sorry that a Swiss store got caught up in a media frenzy.
The row blew up after Winfrey cited her treatment in the store as an example of racism.
The store assistant tells a Swiss newspaper she feels terrible, hasn't been able to sleep.
"It's not an indictment against the country or even that store," says Winfrey.
