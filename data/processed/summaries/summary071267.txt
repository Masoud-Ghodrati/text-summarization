Hillary Clinton was effusive in her praise of Warren on Friday.
"I love watching Elizabeth," Clinton said, labeling Warren a "passionate champion for working people".
By comparison Warren offered this about Clinton: "Happy to welcome Secretary Clinton back to the commonwealth".
If both women run for president, they would face each other in the Democratic primary.
