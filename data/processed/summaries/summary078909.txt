Bob Greene: Case of a recent Ohio "Whites Only" sign points up ugly part of U.S. history.
He says such signs once not uncommon in South, and also North, even into the 1960s.
He says children, in particular, absorb messages on signs; internalize them as official.
Greene: It's meaningful that Ohio story made news; a reminder of the American journey.
