NEW: Knox hopes DNA report due Thursday will help her defense, her father says.
Amanda Knox says she is "shocked" by the testimony of Rudy Guede.
Guede, convicted separately of killing Meredith Kercher, denies another convict's story.
Knox and her former boyfriend were found guilty in 2009 of killing Kercher in Perugia.
