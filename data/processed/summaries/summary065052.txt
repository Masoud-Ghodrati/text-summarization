"Universal background checks" refer to closing loopholes in federal gun sales laws.
Those loopholes apply to private gun sales that usually involve gun shows.
Advocates say 40% of gun sales are private transactions, including gun shows.
NRA challenges the 40% figure and disputes the "loophole" characterization.
