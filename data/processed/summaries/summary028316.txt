A deputy who was part of a unit targeting human smuggling is accused.
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio calls the alleged connections "despicable".
A detention officer had $16,000 in her purse when she was arrested, Arpaio says.
Critics recently called for Arpaio's resignation after a government audit of his agency.
