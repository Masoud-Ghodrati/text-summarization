French intervention in Mali could be turning point in relationship with Africa, writes Lansana Gberie.
France's meddling to bolster puppet regimes in the past has outraged Africans, he argues.
He says few in Africa would label the French action in Mali as 'neo-colonial mission creep'.
Lansana: 'Africa's weakness has been exposed by the might of a foreign power'.
