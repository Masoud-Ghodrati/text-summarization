Lewis Beale: This summer's movies show America's growing addiction to 'destruction porn'.
He says from 'Godzilla,' to 'X-Men' and beyond, it's not just violence, it's maximum mayhem.
He says if films have long reflected our anxieties, recent films show psychic meltdown.
Beale: Annihilation now entertains us. Hollywood feeds this lust. We should worry.
