Cathy Ladman laments Kevin Smith's getting bumped from a flight because of his size.
She says such treatment is routine for fliers now, unlike the days when flying was fun.
Indignities -- security measures, no food -- begin early and last till you've landed, she says.
Ladman: It's only a matter of time till Smith's treatment becomes routine even off the plane.
