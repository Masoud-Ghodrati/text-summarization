Several leaders have tried to help ease tensions in the wake of the death of Michael Brown.
The list starts with the police chief whose officer shot Brown on August 8.
On Wednesday, a prosecutor's team will seek to present the facts of the case to a grand jury.
Even the U.S. attorney general has stepped into the response effort.
