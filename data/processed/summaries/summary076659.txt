Kora master Toumani Diabate is one of Africa's most famous musicians.
His newest band, AfroCubism, blends together the sounds of West Africa and Cuba.
The long-awaited band received a Grammy nomination last year for "Best World Music Album".
Diabate's mission is to keep the sound of the kora alive.
