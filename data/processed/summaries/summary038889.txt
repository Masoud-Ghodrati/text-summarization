Snow has caused damage to the Colosseum in Rome and to historic buildings in Urbino.
Plunging temperatures caused ice to form on Colosseum walls, forcing off small pieces of rock.
Delicate houses in Urbino's historic walled center have suffered collapses.
Worst snowfall in Italy for many years; said to be equivalent of a severe flood.
