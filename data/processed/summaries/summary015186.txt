A Shanghai metro employee says women need to dress more modestly to avoid sexual harassment in the metro.
The post included a picture of a woman in a semi-transparent dress in a metro platform.
The online statement came after complaints of four separate incidents of sexual harassment in June.
Backlash against the company has populated Chinese social media sites such as Sina Weibo.
