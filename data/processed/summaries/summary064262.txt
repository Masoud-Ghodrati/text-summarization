Tim Stanley: The VP candidates reflect divide between liberal and conservative Catholicism.
He says Biden is a post-Vatican II Catholic aimed at social justice and accessible faith.
He says Ryan hews to traditional Catholicism; record is anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage.
Stanley: Ryan will have to show social compassion with fiscal conservatism.
