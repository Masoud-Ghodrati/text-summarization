Niki Lauda says Ferrari has made a "very good" decision by signing Kimi Raikkonen for 2014.
The three-time world champion says it will also provide a "kick" for Fernando Alonso.
He warns managing Raikkonen and Alonso in 2014 will take "strong leadership".
Lauda says bringing Lewis Hamilton to Mercedes made "hell of a difference".
