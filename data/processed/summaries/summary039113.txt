NEW: Karzai: Civilian deaths causing serious tensions between Afghanistan and allies.
Afghan president says such strikes can't be used "even if NATO forces are attacked".
NATO says it will no longer use airstrikes on civilian homes if "other means" are available.
The shift comes after an airstrike last week in Logar province that killed 18 people.
