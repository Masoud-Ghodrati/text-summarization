Pope Francis urges the Curia to be professional and to serve the rest of the church.
He also warns against gossip, saying it is harmful to people and the church's work.
This is Francis' first Christmas message to the Roman Curia.
Since becoming pope, he has been taking steps to reform the way the Holy See is run.
