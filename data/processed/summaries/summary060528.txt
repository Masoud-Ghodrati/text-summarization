Peggy Drexler: Disney retooled Princess Merida from "Brave" movie as "babe" for doll.
Director's criticism of "sexist marketing" implies pretty girls not role models, Drexler says.
She says dolls are for fantasy, and parents help kids use their imagination.
Drexler: Calling new Merida sexist sends poor message.
