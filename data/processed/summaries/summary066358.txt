A cougar jumped a man walking with a skateboard in Banff, Alberta.
"He hit the animal with the skateboard and stunned him," park official says.
Cougar attacks on people are rare since the cats are "very wary of people," official says.
Skateboards used to defend against cougars is even rarer, he says.
