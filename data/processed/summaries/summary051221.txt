WikiLeaks released more than 75,000 U.S. military documents on Afghan war.
Fareed Zakaria says comparison to Pentagon Papers was excessive.
He says the new documents show detail on things that had been known before.
Zakaria: U.S. efforts in Afghan war are out of proportion to the threat, should be reduced.
