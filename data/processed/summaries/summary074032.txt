The remains of 220 disabled people are thought to be buried in the Austrian graveyard.
Historians think the people were killed by Nazis trying to eliminate "undesirables".
A map of the graves was found by historians studying hospital records.
The company that runs the hospital plans to exhume them starting in March.
