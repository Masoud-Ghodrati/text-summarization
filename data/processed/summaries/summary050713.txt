Iranian Pegah Ahangarani is actress and activist, as is Iranian-born Nazanin Boniadi.
But Boniadi has never been harassed for activism, while Ahangarani is sentenced to jail.
Boniadi: 845 people are political prisoners in Iran, from all walks of life and careers.
Boniadi: Human rights in Iran should be just as important as nuclear  issues.
