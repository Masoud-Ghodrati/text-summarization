Bonnie Fuller: The media and the public went hog wild over the Diana and Charles nuptials.
She says that after the wedding, she she got to meet Diana twice.
Diana was stunning, and you could see her toned arms in a sleek navy gown, Fuller says.
She says if Diana were here Friday, she'd be beaming to the Westminster Abbey rafters.
