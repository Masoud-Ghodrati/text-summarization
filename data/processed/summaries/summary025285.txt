Research into the H7N9 virus suggests the risk of contracting serious illness rises with age.
China's health ministry on Monday confirmed a total of 105 cases and 21 deaths.
The virus has been identified in Beijing, Shanghai and four provinces including Shandong for the first time.
The WHO has said so far there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission in H7N9.
