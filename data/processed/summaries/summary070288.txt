NEW: The search for survivors continues after a boat carrying 28 Haitian migrants sinks.
The boat, bound for the United States, ran aground off Hawksbill Cay, the U.S. Coast Guard says.
Eleven bodies have been found and 13 people remain missing; four made it to shore.
About 587,000 Haitian-born people live in the United States, 2010 Census figures show.
