John Avlon: New York's primary election sent an important message.
He says voters chose to reject comeback attempts of Anthony Weiner and Eliot Spitzer.
Avlon says Republicans wisely chose not to nominate candidate with the most money.
Voters also didn't vote strictly along ethnic or demographic lines, he says.
