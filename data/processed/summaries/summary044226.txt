Tax records show two veterans charities spent more than $78 million on direct mail marketing.
One of the charities is trying to end its relationship with the marketing company.
CharityWatch gave both charities an "F" for spending only 12% on helping veterans.
"Who's benefiting here other than the fund-raising company?" asks CharityWatch.
