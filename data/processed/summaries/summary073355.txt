Robert Graboyes: 3-D printers are opening up possibilities for low-cost prosthetics.
FDA-approved prosthetic hands, for example, can cost $40,000. Printed ones, about $50.
He says "permissionless innovation" lets design of 3-D printed hands quickly evolve.
Graboyes: Such unleashed innovation should be applied across all of health care.
