UN report found Israeli blockade of Gaza "legitimate" but was critical of  "excessive force".
Fadi Hakura says bilateral relations suffered as a result of military action in Gaza.
He believes the Turkish prime minister's popularity partly stems from his stance on Israel.
Hakura says if the U.S. manages the situation, then regional implications can be contained.
