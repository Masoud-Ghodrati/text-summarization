Creature Creator allows gamers to design characters for new "Spore" game.
Some users have created sexual creatures, now known as "Sporn".
"Spore" maker EA is banning those who continue to upload offensive creations.
One Sporn creator: "I don't think there's anything perverted, vile or awful about it".
