Yahoo and China's Alibaba Group have agreed to a $7.1 billion share buyback deal.
The China internet behemoth will buy back half of Yahoo's 40% stake in the company.
Comes after the departure of Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a resume padding scandal.
The relationship between Alibaba and Yahoo has often been fractious.
