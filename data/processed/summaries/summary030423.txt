Ukraine's president and opposition have reached a deal to end violence.
It's fragile, says Steven Pifer, but it is the best deal available to Ukraine right now.
The deal restores the 2004 constitution and calls for a new unity government.
Pifer: Russia may undermine the deal, but the U.S. and EU must work to bolster it.
