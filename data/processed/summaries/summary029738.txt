Arid Uka "deeply regrets" and fully confesses his crime, his lawyers say.
He is accused of shooting dead two U.S. servicemen and injuring two others.
He acted after seeing an Internet clip apparently showing U.S. soldiers raping a Muslim woman.
The footage was in reality a scene from an anti-war film, the court heard.
