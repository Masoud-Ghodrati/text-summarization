South Korean pop star PSY apologized for what he called "inflammatory" lyrics.
PSY rapped in 2004: 'Kill those f---ing Yankees who have been torturing Iraqi captives'.
The lyrics, posted in October on CNN iReport, exploded on blogs, social media months later.
PSY: 'I will be forever sorry for any pain I have caused by those words'.
