Embraer, founded over 40 years ago, is also looking to make inroads into the U.S. defense market.
Frederico Curado, head of Embraer, told CNN the company had combined "the best of both worlds".
U.S. Air Force announced it had selected Embraer Defense for a contract for 20 aircraft worth $427 million.
