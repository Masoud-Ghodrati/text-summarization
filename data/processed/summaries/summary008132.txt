Slovenia will be able to stave off a bailout, the country's finance minister Janez Sustersic says.
The country's economy is in recession and its downturn is expected to continue next year.
The country is driving through privatizations, pension and labor reforms to recover.
Sustersic said the country was better off being in the euro, despite the financial crisis.
