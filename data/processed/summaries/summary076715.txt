NEW: "Today is an interesting day," New York City's elections commissioner says.
"It's inspiring to see so many people up and out to vote," one woman says.
"We have everybody coming in from everywhere," a poll coordinator says.
The city Board of Elections temporarily relocated or combined some polling locations.
