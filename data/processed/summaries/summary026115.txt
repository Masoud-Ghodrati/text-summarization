Pro-democracy activists launch a campaign to "occupy" the city's financial district.
Their goal is to pressure China into giving the former British colony full universal suffrage.
Not everyone shares the activists goal but many residents are unhappy.
China says that Hong Kong does not enjoy "full autonomy".
