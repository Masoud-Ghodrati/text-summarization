NEW: U.S. officials advise Americans not to travel to North Korea.
Merrill Newman, 85, was detained on October 26 in Pyongyang, his son says.
Newman was taken off a departing plane by North Korean authorities, his son says.
Newman has a heart condition, and the family is uncertain if he has received medication.
