Adm. Brian Losey writes an open letter to Navy SEALs on October 31.
The letter came just days before a "60 Minutes" appearance by Matt Bissonnette.
Bissonnette said he was on the Pakistan raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed.
Losey reminds SEALs they've made a vow to maintain mission secrecy and eschew glory.
