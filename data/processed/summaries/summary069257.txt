"Very few ships ... received a failing score over the last couple of years," CDC official says.
Holland America's ms Veendam, which CDC inspectors visited in August, got a 77.
An 85 or lower on the CDC's 100-point inspection scale is considered failing.
The cruise line says "the unsatisfactory score is highly unusual and an aberration".
