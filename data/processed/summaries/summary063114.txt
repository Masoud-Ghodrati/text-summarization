Slayer's website says Jeff Hanneman's liver-failure death was linked to a spider bite.
Website says he "contracted necrotizing fasciitis ... likely caused by a spider bite".
A doctor tells CNN bites don't lead to organ failure but infected bites can cause problems.
Hanneman was among founders of heavy metal band Slayer in 1981.
