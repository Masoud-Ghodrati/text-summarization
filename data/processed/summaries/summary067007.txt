Dean Obeidallah: Many think VP is a useless position, but it may be the best job in the country.
He says it's like being a lesser Kardashian: perks, fame, salary and almost no responsibilities.
Other perks are: no one wants your job, no one shoots at you; luxury to stay stupid things.
Obeidallah: Quayle had a word for responsibility, and "that one word is 'to be prepared'".
