Maureen Fields of southern Nevada was 41 when she went missing in 2006.
Her abandoned car, with keys, purse and pill bottles, was found off a desert highway.
Presumed dead, there's been no sign of her body and no evidence pointing to a killer.
Unknown male's DNA, however, was recently discovered and may hold new clues.
