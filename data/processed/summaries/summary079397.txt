Mathieu Kassovitz was just 28 when he won Best Director at Cannes for "La Haine".
Success in Hollywood has taken him to L.A. but he prefers to live in Paris.
He says Paris is inspirational for a director because of its place in film history.
If Paris was a person, he says it would be "a good-looking girl with a big mouth".
