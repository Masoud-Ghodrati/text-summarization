Austin Taylor Bice, 22, was last seen outside a Madrid disco last Saturday.
Missing-person posters are appearing in Madrid and on Spanish media.
Bice's father has come from the U.S. and plans to stay "as long as I need to".
There are about 17,000 American students in Spain, an educational institute says.
