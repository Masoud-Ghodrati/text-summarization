Oscar Pistorius' conduct was "negligent," Judge Thokozile Masipa says.
She says Pistorius cannot be found guilty of intentionally killing his girlfriend.
In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces three weapons charges.
The most serious weapons charge is related to ammunition found in his house.
