Poison may have been sprayed into classrooms before girls entered, police spokesman says.
Girls complained of headaches, dizziness and vomiting; many remain hospitalized.
It's the second such poisoning in a week's time.
A police spokesman blamed the Taliban, which has demanded the closure of some schools.
