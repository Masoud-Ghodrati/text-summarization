A Chinese newspaper has come under fire for taking photos of the body of Yao Beina, a popular singer, after her death.
The newspaper issued an apology confirming the incident, and said the photos have been deleted.
Early allegations said that three journalists from the newspaper pretended to be medical staff and sneaked into the room.
