David Moyes suffers eight defeat in 24 league matches in charge of Manchester United.
Saturday's 2-1 loss to Stoke was United's first in the league to that team since 1984.
Manager Moyes blames bad luck and poor finishing in front of goal.
Reverse means United may fall nine points behind fourth place by end of weekend.
