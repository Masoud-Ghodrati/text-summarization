At least 294 people died when the Sewol ferry capsized off South Korea's coast on April 16.
Many of the victims were high school students from the town of Ansan on a field trip.
The Sewol's captain and three crew members are on trial on murder charges, which they deny.
Students began testifying in the trial at a hearing in their hometown Monday.
