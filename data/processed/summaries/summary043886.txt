Avonte Oquendo, 14, was last seen on surveillance video leaving a school on October 4.
He can't communicate verbally; he's fascinated by trains, so search shifts underground.
Police commissioner: "We have hundreds of police officers and detectives" searching for teen.
Family attorney says he's looking into how Avonte could leave school grounds unsupervised.
