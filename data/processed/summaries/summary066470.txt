An Israeli government committee disputes a France 2 report of a Gaza boy's death.
Image of the boy and his father under a hail of Israeli bullets became a powerful symbol.
The father, Jamal al-Durrah, wants an independent inquiry to "show the world the truth".
There's no evidence the IDF was to blame for injuries to the boy or his father, Israeli report says.
