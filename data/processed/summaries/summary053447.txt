An Ohio jury is hearing testimony before recommending a sentence for Anthony Sowell.
The convicted serial killer could face the death penalty or life in prison.
He was convicted last month on 11 counts of aggravated murder and more than 70 other charges.
"I can't explain it and I know it's not a lot, but it's all I can give," he tells the jury.
