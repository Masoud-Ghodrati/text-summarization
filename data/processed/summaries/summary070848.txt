MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams' body was found locked in a bag in 2010.
A coroner's inquest into his death concluded it was likely that someone had killed him.
But Scotland Yard said it was most likely no one else was involved in Williams' death.
Confined spaces expert Peter Faulding believes Williams was murdered in a "'perfect crime".
