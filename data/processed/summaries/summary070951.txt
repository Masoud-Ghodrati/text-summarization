French troops conduct an operation in northern Mali, coordinating with Malian forces.
They kill Ahmed el Tilemsi, co-founder of the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa.
A French official says a dozen other militants were with el Tilemsi when he was killed.
The U.S. had designated el Tilemsi a terrorist, offered a reward of up to $5 million for him.
