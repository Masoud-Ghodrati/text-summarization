The bodies of 7 cargo workers are found in rubble near a cold storage facility at the airport.
29 others were killed in the airport attack, including 10 militants, officials say.
The Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, say the attack is revenge for the death of Hakimullah Mehsud.
Mehsud, a former TTP chief, was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2013.
