Body of unidentified child -- named Baby Hope by police -- was found on July 23, 1991.
Detectives continue to investigate, and ask that anyone with information come forward.
There are many reasons people may talk years later, says Detective Robert Dewhurst.
"Twenty years is not uncommon for a cold case," Dewhurst says.
