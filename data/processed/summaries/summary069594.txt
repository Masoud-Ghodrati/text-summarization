Wales manager Gary Speed was found dead at his home on Sunday.
Speed enjoyed a long playing career making 535 English Premier League appearances.
He took charge of the Welsh national side last year and was credited with a recent revival.
Speed's agent and friend tells CNN he may never know why Speed took his own life.
