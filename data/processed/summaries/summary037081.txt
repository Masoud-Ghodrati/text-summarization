German champions Borussia Dortmund pioneer the use of "space age" training.
The "Footbonaut" is a 14-meter cage which delivers balls to a player by eight machines.
The player must then pass to one of 72 panels which is signaled by a flashing green light.
"It is the perfect tool to improve ball-handling skills," says Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp.
