Danny Cevallos: Photog whose camera used in viral monkey selfie wants it off Wikipedia.
Photo is uncopyrightable, says Wikipedia because animals can't own copyright. But can they?.
U.S. copyright law holds work must be in tangible medium, be original and have author.
Cevallos: Animals aren't authors. This selfie doesn't qualify for copyright protection.
