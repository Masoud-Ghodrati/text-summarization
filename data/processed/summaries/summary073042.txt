NEW: The Navy secretary calls the move "good for the university, good for the military".
Harvard's president and the Navy secretary will sign a deal to return ROTC to campus.
The school had banned ROTC, in part due to opposition to the "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
Change will take effect this summer, once the repeal is implemented by the military.
