Melissa Henson: TLC's "Toddlers and Tiaras" promotes sexualization of toddlers, girls.
A 3-year-old wore a padded bra and buttocks, another dressed as a prostitute.
Henson says girls' exposure to hypersexualized media is harmful in many ways.
She says TLC should be ashamed for promoting images of sexed-up toddlers for ratings.
