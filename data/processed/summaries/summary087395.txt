Where can the world find growth? A CNN panel hosted by John Defterios discussed the global economy.
Participants said China would not grow at its explosive rate again, but other economies were also weak.
The panel was held in St Petersburg, Russia, a country which has suffered from falling commodity prices.
Turkey was pointed to as an economy which has potential despite recent protests.
