Police say Karim Benzema was clocked at 216 kph in a 100-kph zone on a Madrid highway.
Authorities did not immediately pursue Benzema because of safety concerns, police say.
They say they tracked him down using the vehicle's license plate.
He could lose his license for at least a year, be jailed or fined, or face community service.
