In May 2011, Siga Technologies won a no-bid, nearly $433 million HHS contract.
Internal government e-mails obtained by CNN show questions were raised.
Siga's controlling shareholder is a longtime Democratic Party activist.
HHS says "after a rigorous market analysis" the contract was based on Siga's ability to produce.
