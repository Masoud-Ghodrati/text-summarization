History-making female jockey Hayley Turner has made history in flat racing.
Not even broken bones or head injuries have kept her away from the Sport of Kings.
Turner is adamant that being a jockey is not a man's world and women can thrive.
She says of her many injuries in her career: "I could break bones all day long".
