Digital 'monkeys' with typewriters complete Shakespeare's "A Lover's Complaint".
Project is the brainchild of a Nevada developer and aims to test the classic "Infinite Monkey Theorem".
It began last month and will continue until The Bard's entire catalogue is reproduced.
The program types random bursts of code, crossing words off when they match Shakespeare's.
