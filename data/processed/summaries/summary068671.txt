A 19-day-old infant disappeared from a Manhattan hospital in 1987.
Prosecutors say she was taken by a woman who raised the child under a different name.
The victim became suspicious as an adult, and DNA tests established her true identity.
The woman who pleaded guilty to taking the infant apologizes.
