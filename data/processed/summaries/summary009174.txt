Apollo Nida must serve 5 years on parole after he does 8 years in prison.
His fraud scheme stole millions from at least 50 people over four years, prosecutor says.
Nida served 5 years in prison before marrying "Housewives" co-star Phaedra Parks.
He was busted after a year-long investigation by the U.S. Secret Service.
