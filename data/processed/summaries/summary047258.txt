Jim Dempsey and daughter, Beverly, were forced to leave Egypt last month amid uprising.
His wife, a USAID employee, had to stay behind.
They've been temporarily relocated to Virgina but now consider Egypt home.
"I want to go back really badly, but that doesn't mean I don't like it here," says Beverly, 10.
