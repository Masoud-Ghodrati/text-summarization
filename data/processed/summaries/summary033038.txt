Jury selection begins in Michael Dunn's retrial on murder charge.
Dunn charged with killing Jordan Davis, 17, after argument over loud music.
Earlier this year, jury found Dunn guilty of three counts of attempted murder.
However, jury was hung on first-degree murder charge, so prosecutors will try again.
