NEW: NJ Sen Frank Lautenberg praises deal, pledges work on long-term solution for workers.
Deal paves way for city payout of at least $625 million to ground zero workers.
Plaintiffs narrowly OK'd deal, which required 95 percent of some 10,000 people to approve.
Some plaintiffs signed onto the agreement to avoid continued litigation.
