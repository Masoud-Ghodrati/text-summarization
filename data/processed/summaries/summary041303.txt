The SETI Institute sets up an online vote to name two of Pluto's moons.
It will use the vote in proposing names to the International Astronomical Union.
Vulcan -- the Roman god of fire and home planet of Spock, of Star Trek fame -- is winning.
William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy have urged Trekkies to vote for the Vulcan name.
