Jean S. Harris was convicted in 1981 of killing her longtime lover, Dr. Herman Tarnower.
Tarnower wrote a best-selling book touting the benefits of a high-protein, low-fat diet.
The case ignited a national debate about Harris and the shooting.
She claimed she accidentally killed Tarnower in a struggle for a gun.
