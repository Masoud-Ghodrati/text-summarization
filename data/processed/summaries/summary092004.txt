Philip Lerman oversaw the missing child cases for "America's Most Wanted".
60 cases were solved but not the personal one: his stepsister's disappearance.
He saw brave families hold out hope, and show would air and re-air their cases.
Lerman says every family of a missing child is holding onto hope after women found.
