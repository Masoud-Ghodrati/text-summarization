Michael Schumacher's wife asks for privacy as the Formula One racer remains in a critical condition.
She also asks for the media to leave the French hospital where he is being treated.
Doctors say Schumacher's condition is stable but that he is being constantly monitored.
The racing driver hit his head on a rock while skiing at the end of December.
