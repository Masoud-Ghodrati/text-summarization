Aircraft recovery group says metal piece may be from Amelia Earhart's plane.
Group: Metal patch is "as unique to her particular aircraft as a fingerprint is to an individual".
Group's theory is that Earhart's plane landed on Nikumaroro, a deserted island in the Pacific.
In June 2015, group will go to island to try and find the plane.
