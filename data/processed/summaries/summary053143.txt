Murder suspect Shrien Dewani extradited from UK to face trial in South Africa.
Dewani has resisted extradition for the past three years on the grounds of mental health.
He is accused of orchestrating his new wife's death in Cape Town in November 2010.
Until he stands trial, Dewani will likely be held in a notorious secure psychiatric facility in the city.
