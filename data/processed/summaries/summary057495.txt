Haitian American Duwon Steven Clark returned to Ghana in search of his ancestors.
He visited Cape Coast Castle, one of more than two dozen "slave castles" on the coast.
Four out of 10 West African slaves shipped to the Americas never survived the journey.
Clark's ancestors did. He says his presence at the castle shows the slavers did not win.
