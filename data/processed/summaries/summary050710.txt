Rwandan Paul Kagame spent the first three decades of his life as a refugee.
As head of the Tutsi rebel militia, he fought against Hutu government forces.
A 100-day Hutu slaughter of Tutsis left 800,000 dead before Hutus were defeated.
Today, Kagame is president of Rwanda and insists Hutus and Tutsis reconcile.
