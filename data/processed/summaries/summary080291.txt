A Spanish court says Inaki Urdangarin must testify on February 6.
A statement from the court names him as a defendant, but does not specify charges.
The corruption case has brought increased scrutiny to Spain's royal family.
Urdangarin, a former Olympic handball player, is married to the king's youngest daughter.
