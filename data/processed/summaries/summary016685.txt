Gregoire Ndahimana was mayor of Kivumu at the time of the 1994 genocide.
He was accused of involvement in a massacre at a church in which 2,000 people died.
The judges find him guilty of aiding and abetting genocide and extermination.
Some 800,000 people, mostly ethnic Tutsis, were killed in the three-month bloodletting.
