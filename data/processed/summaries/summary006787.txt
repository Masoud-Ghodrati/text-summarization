At his trial, Francesco Schettino says he's not the only person responsible for the ship crash.
He wants divers to see if watertight doors and automatic generators worked properly.
He also wants judges to see a re-creation of the night of the crash from the command bridge.
The liner crashed on the rocks off Giglio Island in January 2012, killing 32 people.
