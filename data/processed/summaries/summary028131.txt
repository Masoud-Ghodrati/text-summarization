Striker Carlos Tevez has been suspended for two weeks by Manchester City.
The suspension follows his non-appearance from the bench against Bayern Munich.
Tevez earlier issued a statement denying that he had refused to play when asked.
City coach Roberto Mancini has said Tevez will never play for the club again.
