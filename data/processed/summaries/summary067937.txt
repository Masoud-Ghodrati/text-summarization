NEW: Musharraf plans to plead not guilty to the charges, his lawyer says.
The ex-president will appear in court next week where he'll be indicted, the lawyer says.
The charges relate to the assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto in 2007.
Musharraf is accused of failing to provide adequate security for Bhutto.
