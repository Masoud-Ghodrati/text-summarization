Chase Merritt told CNN in January that he met Joseph McStay in 2007.
They did business together but they were also close friends, Merritt says.
He was the last person to see McStay the day he, his wife and two kids vanished, he told CNN.
Police believe Merritt, acting alone, killed the four family members in their home.
