John Avlon: Rank-and-file votes lower than in the past, a bad omen for Mitt Romney and GOP.
GOP turnout flat-lined in some states, Avlon says, and went downhill in Florida, Nevada.
Avlon points to polarization, the effect of negative ads and dissatisfaction with candidates.
More bad news, he says: No candidate is likely to appeal to independents, centrists.
