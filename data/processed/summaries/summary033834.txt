Warm waters off Peru have chased away fish, a national center studying El Nino says.
Fish flee south to deeper, cooler waters, leaving 5,000 Peruvian surface-feeding birds dead.
Chilean birds have apparently feasted on such fleeing fish, an environment professor says.
Many of the dead Chilean birds have injuries consistent with getting trapped in fishing nets.
