"She is safe, she is unharmed, she is OK," police chief says of Brittany Thompson.
She was last seen Monday leaving the Medfield Public Library with a man.
It's not known if the man Thompson was found with was the one she left the library with.
She didn't appear to be hurt and wasn't taken to a hospital when she was found, chief says.
