The Pakistani authorities have previously linked Save the Children to the CIA.
The government has now ordered six foreigners working for the group to leave.
The aid group denies the accusations and says the order hasn't been explained.
A 2011 report alleges that Save the Children helped in the hunt for bin Laden.
