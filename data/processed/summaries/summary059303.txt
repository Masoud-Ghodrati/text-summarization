NEW: Musicians describe Hanneman as a "true master," "metal god" and "legend".
Hanneman was among those who founded the heavy metal band Slayer in 1981.
He co-wrote two songs on Slayer's landmark 1986 album, "Reign in Blood".
He was at a California hospital when he suffered liver failure, his band says.
