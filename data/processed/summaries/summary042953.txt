Roman Polanski fled the United States after pleading guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old.
U.S. authorities wanted him arrested while in Poland, an official there says.
Prosecutors found no reason to detain him, lawyer for Polanski says.
The Oscar-winning director says he hopes that means the end of the U.S. extradition quest.
