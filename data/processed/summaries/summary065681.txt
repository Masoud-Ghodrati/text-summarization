Decision on the verdict against Donald Kagan put off until September 22.
Judge in 1999 case has shed doubt on the murder conviction he handed down.
He now says he was racially biased against the defendant, prompting review.
"It's not fair," says girlfriend of Wavell Wint, who was shot by Kagan during a fight.
