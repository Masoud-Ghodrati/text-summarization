Former CNN correspondent looks at the case of Merrill Newman, arrested in North Korea in 2013.
Newman, who advised South Korean troops in the Korean war, was detained for months in the reclusive state.
Accused of espionage, the octogenarian had no way of knowing when -- or even if -- he would be released.
Chinoy retells Merrill's striking story in an essay, "The Last POW," with an excerpt published exclusively on CNN.
