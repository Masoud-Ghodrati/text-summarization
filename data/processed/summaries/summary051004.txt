Paul Begala: Bill Clinton was determined to include a call to service during his administration.
AmeriCorps started 20 years ago with bipartisan support to let young people serve, he says.
Nearly a million have joined; helped in 9/11, Katrina, with veterans, the old, poor, children.
Begala: As Obama swears in new volunteers, we should thank Clinton for AmeriCorps.
