Megaupload founder Kim Dotcom launches a political party in New Zealand.
His party needs at least 5% of the vote or a constituency win to get into parliament.
There is no clear front-runner for the vote, expected to take place at the end of the year.
He is also launching an album at his birthday bash on January 20.
