American Ibolya Ryan, 47, was stabbed in a restroom at a high-end mall, police say.
The suspect had logged on to "terrorist websites," an official says.
In October, the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi warned of a threat to attack teachers.
Ryan's ex-husband says the UAE has given him the power to commute a death sentence.
