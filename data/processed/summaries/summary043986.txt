NBC sportscaster Bob Costas says he felt need to address gun issue.
Costas told Piers Morgan he wished he had time on halftime show to elaborate on concerns.
Costas: "The culture of the league increases the likelihood of abhorrent behavior".
Guns increase likelihood of something bad happening, Costas says.
