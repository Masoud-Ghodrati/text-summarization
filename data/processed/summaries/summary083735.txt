14 Moon Bears have been rescued from a bear bile farm in Vietnam.
The bears were illegally harvested for their bile which is used in folk remedies.
The painful process often leads to a slow and agonizing death for the bear.
The rescue marks the first time a large number of bears was relinquished on conscience.
