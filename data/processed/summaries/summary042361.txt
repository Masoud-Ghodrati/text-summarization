Paul Grosswiler: Maine Gov. LePage's language is offensive frothing of an abusive bully.
Grosswiler: LePage attacks with invective any group that stands in his way, even his own party.
Grosswiler: He throws tantrums, storms out, refuses to meet leaders, insults reporters.
LePage has embarrassed Maine, he says, and will go away if he hits national stage.
