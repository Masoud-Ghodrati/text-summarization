David Weinberger: Many angry over Facebook's psychological experiment on users in 2012.
He says it was only a more intrusive version of what FB and other websites do all the time.
FB decides what we'll know about friends based on what profits FB, he says.
Weinberger: Facebook could use this control to better society, but the bottom line comes first.
