GOP Gabriel Gomez is running against Democrat Ed Markey for Massachusetts Senate seat.
Paul Begala: Gomez is styled as a "new kind of Republican," but that's far from true.
Begala: His military record is impressive, but his politics are standard old GOP.
Begala: He opposes Obamacare and abortion and is on the side of the wealthy.
