Identical twin sisters didn't know the other existed for the first 25 years of their lives.
They connected via Facebook in a modern-day "Parent Trap" story.
In a new book "Separated @ Birth," the sisters document how they found each other.
The sisters hope their story will help other adoptees reunite with family.
