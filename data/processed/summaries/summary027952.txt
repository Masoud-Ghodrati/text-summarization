Valarie Kaur: GOP will make history when a Sikh leads thousands in prayer at RNC.
Kaur: If this is to be more than a gesture, GOP must speak out against hate.
Most Sikhs are pleased that a Sikh prayer will be delivered on a national platform, she says.
Kaur's Sikh father was with GOP but switched after he saw discrimination in party.
