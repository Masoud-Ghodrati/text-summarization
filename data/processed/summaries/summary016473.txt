Evan Thomas: Biggest decision for next president could be on bombing Iran's nuclear facilities.
He says Eisenhower pondered a pre-emptive strike against a rising nuclear power: the USSR.
He was pressed by some to strike but grasped the magnitude and decided not to do it.
Thomas: Ike was good bluffer; faced with similar decision, will our next president fare as well?.
