Thailand's constitutional court has declared the country's February 2 election invalid.
An opposition boycott and protests meant candidates were not fielded in all constituencies.
The court said voting must take place across the country on the same day to be lawful.
Its decision is final and no appeal can be filed, meaning new elections must be held.
