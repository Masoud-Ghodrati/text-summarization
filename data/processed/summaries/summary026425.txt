Joe Rickey Hundley pleaded guilty to assault in federal court, his attorney says.
He was accused of slapping a crying 19-month-old boy on a Minneapolis-to-Atlanta flight.
Hundley had learned the day before that his own son was in a coma, the court heard.
He is due to be sentenced on January 6, his attorney says.
