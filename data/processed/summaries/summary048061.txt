The FCC is asked Wednesday to consider updating its cell phone radiation standard.
The new standard would allow U.S. cell phones to emit up to 20% more radiation.
The question was presented to the FCC in a new Government Accountability Office report.
It also asked the FCC to test for cell phones being used next to the body, not just at the ear.
