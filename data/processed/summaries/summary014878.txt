Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have streamed into Jordan since 2011.
More than 100,000 Syrians now call Zaatari refugee camp home.
Half of Zaatari's population are children; 42% of families have a female head of household.
U.N. estimates nearly 3 million children in Syria have been forced to quit their education.
