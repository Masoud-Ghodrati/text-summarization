NEW: Kaine says Steele's apology shows Limbaugh is leading GOP force.
Steele earlier said he, not Limbaugh, is "the de facto leader of the Republican Party".
Limbaugh's focus is entertainment, he said. "Yes, it is incendiary. Yes, it is ugly".
Limbaugh backs earlier comments in which he said he hoped president failed.
