South Korean golfer So Yeon Ryu has come a long way since her days as a musician.
Ryu became the fifth player from her country to win the U.S. Women's Open in 2011.
She will tee off at this week's 68th edition of the tournament in New York state.
The 22-year-old was named the LPGA's Rookie of the Year for 2012.
