Elizabeth and Stephen Alderman: Our youngest son, Peter, was killed on 9/11.
After his death, they knew they had to leave a mark that Peter existed.
They set up the Peter C. Alderman Foundation to help people affected by terrorism.
Elizabeth, Stephen Alderman: Peter would be proud of the work that bears his name.
