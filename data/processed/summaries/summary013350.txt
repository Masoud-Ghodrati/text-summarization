Alex Castellanos says it takes some guesswork to predict outcome of such a close election.
He says several factors make Mitt Romney more likely to win.
Romney has made progress in reducing gender gap and may have an edge with independents.
Castellanos: Obama hasn't cracked 50% barrier, and his 2008 win looks unlikely to repeat.
