2-year-old Henry Shakyaver's poses inspire photo series "Henry's Concepts".
Henry's nanny Alex Neary is a photographer who started the series on her site.
The concept: Henry poses for a picture, Neary mimics his pose so he can take her picture.
Neary: "Kids have crazy imaginations. ... Be ready to laugh at yourself".
