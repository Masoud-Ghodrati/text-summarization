Kenneth Williams and Michael Ward are accused of killing Hadiya Pendleton, 15.
Police said Ward confessed to killing the teen in a case of mistaken identity.
The two men pleaded not guilty this week to a host of charges.
Ward's lawyer calls the 141 murder charges against his client, for one death, "absurd".
