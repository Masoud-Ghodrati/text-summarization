Bassem Youssef, a heart surgeon, is a satirical sensation on Egyptian TV.
His show mercilessly mocks politicians and religious radicals, says H.A. Hellyer.
A legal complaint has been filed against him for insulting Egypt's president on the show.
If the case proceeds, there could be free-speech repercussions, says Hellyer.
