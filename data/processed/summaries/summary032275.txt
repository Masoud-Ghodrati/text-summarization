The pilot killed in the crash is identified as Peter Barnes, a married father of two.
Police: "It is something of a miracle that this was not many, many times worse".
"It all happened so fast, it was unbelievable," a witness says.
The crane struck by the helicopter is dangling precariously from the building.
