Mark Coleman: Donna Summer, who died Thursday, defined the disco era of the '70s.
He says her music first found audience in NYC's gay club scene, then gained national fame.
He says her "Love to Love You Baby" was a racy, controversial and influential hit.
Coleman: She developed as artist over years, but her disco hits are biggest legacy.
