Bob Greene: House committee OK'd bill to ban in-flight cell phone calls. This is good news.
He says poll shows most people against voice calls on planes; Congress seems to get this.
Passengers might be trapped on flight with noisy callers; chaos could easily ensue.
Greene: Pols knows if that occurs, fliers will blame them; they should ensure ban happens.
