A golf course in Casey, Illinois hopes to soon boast the world's largest golf tee.
The measurements of the 30ft pine structure have been sent to Guinness World Records.
Bolin Enterprises has already built the world largest wind chime.
The course hopes to add a giant ball to top the tee if the record is confirmed.
