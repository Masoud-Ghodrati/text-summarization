Serena Williams loses 6-0 6-2 to Simona Halep at the year-end championships.
It's Williams' worst defeat since she lost 6-1 6-1 in Oklahoma in 1998.
The result adds to the inconsistent season for the 18-time grand slam winner.
Halep leads the Red Group with a perfect 2-0 record while Williams falls to 1-1.
