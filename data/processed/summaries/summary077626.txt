First study to quantify link between carcinogen byproduct and lung cancer rates.
Researchers tracked levels of byproduct (NNAL) using urine samples.
Smokers with high levels of NNAL doubled their risk of developing lung cancer.
Test could identify high-risk people, aid in early detection and treatment.
Bottom Line: This test may one day be used to identify smokers at high risk for lung cancer, but won't help against smoking's other health hazards..
