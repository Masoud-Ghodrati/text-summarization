U.N.'s Commission of Inquiry (COI) had no cooperation from North Korea, writes Michael Kirby.
Strategy of non-criticism, attempted friendliness to North Korea has not secured peace or human rights compliance.
Veto might prevent action on some of the central recommendations of the COI.
U.N. has responsibility to protect human rights, as duty when given country fails to do so.
