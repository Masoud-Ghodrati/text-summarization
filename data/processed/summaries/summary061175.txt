Bob Greene: Candidates who lose a presidential race have deep, if unexpressed, feelings.
He says many challengers lose, but losing incumbents he's talked to also had complex emotions.
Ford said it wasn't his nature to outwardly lament defeat; Nixon defiant, not seeking sympathy.
Greene: Someone wins, someone loses; it's painful to be told by voters: you're not the one.
