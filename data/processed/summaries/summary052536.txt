Matthew Allen, 16, has 10 brothers and sisters who look out for him.
They love him deeply but Matt's severe autism "strains every relationship in the home".
They also say he has given them gifts of empathy, flexibility and patience.
The Allens hope that when Matt grows up he can work and enjoy leisure in safety.
