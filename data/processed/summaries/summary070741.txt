New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was asked about requiring vaccines, while he was visiting London.
The scientific community overwhelmingly endorses vaccines and the CDC says the U.S. "has the safest, most effective vaccine supply in history".
Christie's spokesman later clarified his comment to say that Christie believes there's "no question" that kids should get the measles vaccine".
