Painting was donated to the National Trust in 2010, and put on display at Buckland Abbey.
Work was originally identified as being by a follower of Dutch master Rembrandt van Rijn.
New tests reveal the portrait, which shows Rembrandt at the age of 29, is by the artist himself.
Re-attribution means the painting is now worth more than $30 million -- but it cannot be sold.
