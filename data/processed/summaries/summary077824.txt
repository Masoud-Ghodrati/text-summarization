Lana Kuykendall was healthy when she gave birth to twins on May 7, her family says.
She's been in a South Carolina hospital since May 11 after noticing a bruise on her leg.
She is battling necrotizing fasciitis, a rare condition that attacks healthy body tissue.
"We don't know what the next day is going to bring," her brother says.
