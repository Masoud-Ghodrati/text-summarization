This complaint letter was sent to Virgin Atlantic boss Sir Richard Branson.
It spread across the Internet, prompting speculation it was a Virgin PR stunt.
Author Oliver Beale said it was a genuine complaint about state of his meal.
Beale: "Once it was regurgitated it was clearly then blended and mixed with  mustard".
