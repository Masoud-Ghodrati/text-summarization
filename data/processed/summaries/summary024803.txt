America's most prestigious horse race -- the Kentucky Derby -- is run Saturday.
Kevin Krigger is adamant he will be first black jockey in 111 years to win.
African American riders used to dominate the sport, winning 15 of first 28 Derbies.
Confident Krigger says success will have nothing to do with skin color.
