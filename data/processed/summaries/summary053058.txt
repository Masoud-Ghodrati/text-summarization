Mitch McConnell says the Senate will vote on a bill authorizing military action against ISIS in early 2015.
The incoming Senate majority leader says he wants President Barack Obama to request the authority for war.
Obama would be in a "much stronger position" if the fight against ISIS with congressional support, McConnell says.
