Preston Bailey is known for fantasy floral designs, but the same rules apply on any budget.
Focus on visible, high-impact areas, like a bride's bouquet or table centerpieces.
Research before you buy so you know when they'll be in full bloom.
Bailey: Trim stems at an angle, skip chemicals and change water every day.
