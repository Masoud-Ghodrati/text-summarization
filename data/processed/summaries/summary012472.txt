"The World's Most Avid Golfer" is set to complete his 600th round of 2010.
Richard Lewis will play the landmark round on December 26 in Dallas, Texas.
The 64-year-old will continue to play until end of 2010 and his total is set to reach 611.
He has missed playing only 19 days this year, all due to inclement weather.
