Angola launches $5bn Sovereign Wealth Fund to decrease future reliance on oil revenues.
Angola is Africa's second largest exporter of oil -- more than ninety percent of the country's revenue comes from oil production.
The country ranks poorly on measures of corruption and little of the oil revenue has been spent on improving public services.
In an exclusive interview, President's son tells CNN that fund will be transparent and independently audited.
