Johann Breyer was a guard at Auschwitz, where more than 1 million people were killed.
He denies persecuting anyone, saying he was only a perimeter guard.
Breyer, in the U.S. for 60 years, won a legal battle to keep U.S. citizenship in 2003.
His case is similar to that of John Demjanjuk, who died this year.
