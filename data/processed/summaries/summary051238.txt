Trayvon Martin was a typical teen and an average student, his friends and parents say.
He loved football, airplanes, and R&B music.
Martin was suspended from school, but his mother said his misbehavior was not violent.
"My son had a future. My son was not one of these thugs in the night," Tracy Martin said..
