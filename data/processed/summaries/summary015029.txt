Gene Seymour: It's no surprise Hollywood picked "Argo" for best picture Academy Award.
He says that's because its plot has Hollywood saving the day, stoking industry's self-image.
He says if not for that, "Lincoln" or technologically striking "Life of Pi" might have cleaned up.
Seymour: He says Oscar can't make telecast with youth appeal without alienating older viewers.
