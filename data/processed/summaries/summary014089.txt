Deisy Garcia and her two small daughters were stabbed to death in January.
Garcia's ex-husband -- the girls' father -- faces first-degree murder charges.
Garcia filed a domestic-abuse report last year, in her native Spanish.
NYPD officials say they can't explain why the report didn't get translated for possible action.
