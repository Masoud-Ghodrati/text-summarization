Venus and Serena Williams have been beset by health issues in recent times.
Serena suffered blood clots on her lungs, and Venus has Sjogren's syndrome.
Seven-time grand slam winner Venus makes her return to the WTA Tour on Wednesday.
The former world No. 1 has not played since pulling out of the U.S. Open in August 2011.
