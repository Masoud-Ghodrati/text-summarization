Former GOP Vice President Dick Cheney says he supports the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell".
"Don't ask, don't tell" was officially repealed on September 20.
"Don't ask, don't tell" prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military.
Members of the audience at a GOP debate booed a gay soldier for asking about the repeal.
