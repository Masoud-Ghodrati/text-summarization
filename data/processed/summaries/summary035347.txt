Bob Meola authored a resolution for Berkeley City Council calling Pfc. Bradley Manning a hero.
He says Manning, if he is source for WikiLeaks, deserves thanks for exposing official wrongdoing.
Berkeley City Council member Gordon Wozniak says Manning should have day in court.
He says passing resolution would encourage others to leak classified material.
