Garden at Oakland's new cathedral provides relief to victims of church sex abuse.
"It's a really small, important physical representation of a horrific thing".
Cathedral's provost says, "We wanted to have a place respectful for their needs".
In July, Pope Benedict XVI called the sexual abuse acts by priests "evil".
