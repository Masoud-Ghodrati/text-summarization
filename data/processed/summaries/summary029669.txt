Photocroms were the functional equivalent of Instagram in 1888.
They were produced using emerging photographic techniques and paint.
Some of the images feature the Great Lakes, Old South, Wild West, and Pacific coast.
A collection of Photocroms have been published for the first time in a new volume.
