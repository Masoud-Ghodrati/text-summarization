Daniel Nickerson was diagnosed eight months ago with an inoperable brain tumor.
A social media push brought 100,000 letters to Daniel's mailbox.
"He just loves getting mail, he's always running to the mailbox," Daniel's aunt says.
The New England Patriots give Daniel a special sixth birthday honor.
