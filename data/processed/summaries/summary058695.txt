Russia's foreign ministry says the verdict against Viktor Bout is "baseless and biased".
Bout was sentenced to 25 years in prison by a New York court.
He was convicted last year on four counts stemming from weapons deals.
Moscow will do all it can to bring about Bout's return to Russia, the foreign ministry says.
