Five have died in shark attacks off Australia in the past 10 months, says Mike Coots.
As a shark-attack survivor myself, I feel these losses keenly, Coots says.
Coots: Still, a healthy shark population equals a healthy marine ecosystem.
Australian law protects the great white, and that law must stay, Coots says.
