A study done for NASA foresees astronauts being unconscious for Mars travel.
It would use a medical method called therapeutic hypothermia.
It is usually used to save trauma patients by inducing torpor, a type of hibernation.
The study says it would be better for the astronauts and deeply cut costs.
