U.S. couple were horrified to see kids picking through garbage at a dump in Cambodia.
The experience haunted Bill and Lauren Smith, and they decided to help two sisters.
They paid for girls' education so they wouldn't have to collect recyclables for money at dump.
The Smiths later started a nonprofit organization called A New Day Cambodia.
