John McCain campaign ads appeared on Web sites that are strongly anti-Obama.
McCain aide says the ads are placed by Google and campaign doesn't choose sites.
He says the offending sites have been added to list of blocked URLs.
The 3 sites involved attack Barack Obama's character; one compares him to Hitler.
