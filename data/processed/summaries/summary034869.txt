The tapes were key pieces of evidence in the sexual assault trial of Warren Jeffs.
Jeffs, a polygamist sect leader, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 12 and 15-year-old.
Jeffs refers to having sexual relations with him as "heavenly sessions".
'The Lord has intended that my ladies, all of my ladies be trained," Jeffs says.
