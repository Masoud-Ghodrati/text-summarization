Amine El Khalifi made a brief appearance in federal court Wednesday.
He waived his right to have a preliminary hearing and to contest his detention.
El Khalifi was arrested Friday as the result of an FBI sting operation.
He accepted a gun and what he thought was a bomb vest, according to the complaint.
