Brittany Trilford, 17, will address world leaders at the Rio + 20 summit next week.
"I envision a future where every person's rights are respected and protected," she says.
She believes that schools should encourage creativity and collaboration.
We should take inspiration from nature and learn to re-use waste, says Trilford.
