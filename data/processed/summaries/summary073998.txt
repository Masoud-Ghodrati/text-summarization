David Frum: Obama team has focused response on blaming the offensive video.
He says it enables White House to avoid questions about security and foreign policy.
Frum says Obama and aides should be forthrightly defending freedom of speech.
President should use his U.N. General Assembly speech to take a strong stance, Frum says.
