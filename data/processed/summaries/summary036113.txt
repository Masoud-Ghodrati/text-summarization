Anti-government protesters plan to occupy key areas to "shut down" the Thai capital.
They hope to break the political deadlock gripping the country; force Yingluck's government from office.
Protesters allege Yingluck is a puppet of her brother, former PM Thaksin.
Observers say some Thais are growing wearing of the protests months into the political crisis.
