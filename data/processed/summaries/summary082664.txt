One person died, others were injured in a blast at a Kansas City, Missouri, restaurant.
The explosion came after a worker laying cable damaged a 2-inch gas line.
A city official says the worker's company didn't have a permit for the excavation.
Those who do such work without permits could get up to 6 months in jail, he says.
