Indian Relay is a fast-paced, high action sport reserved to the Rocky Mountain West.
Little-known outside the tribes, it is arguably America's best kept sporting secret.
Riders race without saddles and helmets in a frenetic relay involving man and beast.
The sport is beginning to gain greater acclaim, with a documentary made about it.
