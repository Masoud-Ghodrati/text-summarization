The Philippines and China are locked in an impasse at a lagoon in the South China Sea.
Both countries claim the area is "an integral part" of their territory.
Manila has sent a coast guard boat and pulled back a naval vessel from the scene.
A third official Chinese ship has reportedly arrived at the lagoon.
