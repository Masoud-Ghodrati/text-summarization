NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip is racing a special car in Sunday's Daytona 500.
The car's number will be changed to 26 for the 26 victims of the Newtown massacre.
There will be a call to action for fans to text "Newtown to 80888" to make a $10 donation.
The Daytona 500 is NASCAR's biggest race and the start of the 2013 season.
