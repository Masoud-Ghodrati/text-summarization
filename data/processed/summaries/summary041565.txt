Efrain Rios Montt ruled Guatemala from 1982 to 1983.
He and another defendant are on trial, accused of genocide and crimes against humanity.
His defense has argued that he never explicitly ordered the killings of an indigenous group.
A judge has thrown out three weeks of testimony in his trial, citing procedural grounds.
