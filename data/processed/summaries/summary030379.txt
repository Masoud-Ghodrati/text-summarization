A man who first refused help is taken safely back to shore, a report says.
Two ice floes break off from the Latvian coast and are blown into the Gulf of Riga.
Helicopters and boats carry more than 220 people to safety, emergency officials say.
A crack appeared in ice that had been attached to the shore, a journalist at the scene says.
