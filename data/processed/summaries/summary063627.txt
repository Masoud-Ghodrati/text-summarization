Authorities search the home Zimmerman shared with his girlfriend, Samantha Scheibe.
Five weapons, including an AR-15, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition are found.
Zimmerman was arrested last week on suspicion of pointing a shotgun at his girlfriend.
He is out on bail and has entered a plea of not guilty.
