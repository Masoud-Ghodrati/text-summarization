Ed Bark: The late David Frost owned the first "big get" interview: Richard Nixon.
He says it bridged showbiz and "hard news," though some questioned his journalistic cred.
He says Frost drew apology from Nixon; Mike Wallace doubted he could do it.
Bark: Frost would interview others -- Perot, Bush -- but the Nixon"get" is his legacy.
