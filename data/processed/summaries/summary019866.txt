Michele Elam says art is emerging as potent tool of Occupy Wall Street movement.
She says this especially true of Shepard Fairey poster that recalls black power imagery.
She says image links movement to long history of marginalized people striving for equity.
Elam: Art serving social function in Occupy as it urges interracial unity, galvanizes social change.
