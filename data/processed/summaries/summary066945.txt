William Wegman's latest picture book "Flo & Wendell Explore" features photos and paintings.
The book was inspired by Wegman's Weimaraner puppies, Flo and Topper.
"You really fall in love with them taking their pictures," Wegman says.
Fans often bring their dogs to meet Wegman at speaking engagements.
