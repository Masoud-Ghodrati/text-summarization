Agnia Grigas: Vladimir Putin has made effective use of his "compatriot" policy.
It enables Russia to gain territory in areas where ethnic Russians and Russian speakers live.
She says Crimea is a place where Russia can claim it was acting for "compatriots".
Grigas: Other nations in Russia's neighborhood should pay attention.
