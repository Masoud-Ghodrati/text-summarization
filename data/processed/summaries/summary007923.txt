Daily Mail said Clooney's future mother-in-law opposes his marriage on religious grounds.
Clooney responds in USA Today, calling the story "completely fabricated" and "dangerous".
The story was removed from the Mail's website, and the paper is investigating.
Clooney rarely responds to the media's stories about his personal life.
