Cameroon's football federation reduces Samuel Eto'o's suspension to eight months.
The national captain had been banned for 15 matches for his role in a player strike.
But now the 30-year-old will sit out four international games and can return in September.
Vice-captain Enoh Eyong had a two-match suspension halved by the federation.
