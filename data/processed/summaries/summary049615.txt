Steinway Street, in Astoria, New York City, is known as "Little Egypt".
The area has long been a home to immigrants, including Germans, Italians and Greeks.
Many merchants there work to support their families in Egypt.
As in the rest of the United States, traders in Little Egypt have been hit by the recession.
