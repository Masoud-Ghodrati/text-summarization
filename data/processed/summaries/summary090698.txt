A long-lost Tennessee Williams story was recently discovered at the University of Texas.
The never-before-published story, "Crazy Night," was buried in the authors' personal papers.
The story was written before Williams found success as a Broadway playwright.
Williams' fans are celebrating the 70th anniversary of his first hit play, "The Glass Menagerie".
