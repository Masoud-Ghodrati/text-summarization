NEW: Israel releases a photo of the car in which the acid attack occurred.
A Palestinian attacked the family and a hitchhiker they were picking up, the IDF says.
The suspect is a 44-year-old Palestinian who's been involved in "hostile" activities, IDF says.
Scattered protests take place in West Bank over death of Palestinian minister.
