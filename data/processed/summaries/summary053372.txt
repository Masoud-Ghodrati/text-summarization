House defeated a bid to kill a defense spending project that Pentagon says it doesn't need.
John Avlon says GOP critics of government spending voted for half-billion dollar project.
He says this was a clear-cut case of a way to cut the budget deficit.
Avlon asks how GOP can run on platform of cutting spending while supporting this project.
