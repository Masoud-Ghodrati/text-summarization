Redoine Faid was a wanted criminal in the '90s known for attacking armored trucks.
He spent more than 10 years in prison, insisted he'd changed, then was arrested again.
Faid held guards at gunpoint and used explosives to burst through a prison's doors.
Law enforcement in France and elsewhere in Europe are now hunting for him.
