Lindsay Lohan must now do community service in L.A. County morgue two days a week.
Lohan is free on bail and hopes to have her probation reinstated, her publicist says.
Her father says she needs "very, very intensive" rehabilitation.
A judge rovokes the actress' probation, and she is led away in handcuffs.
