A statutory rape case is dismissed when the alleged victim, 14, takes her own life.
The 18-year-old former defendant says the sexual encounter was consensual.
Michigan law does not allow only the defendant's testimony to prove a case.
The girl was discovered by her 12-year-old brother after she hanged herself.
