Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were in 2009 convicted of Meredith Kercher's murder.
In 2011, they were acquitted of the crime, but in March 2013 Italy's high court ordered a retrial.
The retrial began in Florence Monday but has been adjourned until October 4.
Kercher's body was found in 2007 in the Perugia flat she and Knox shared with two others.
