NEW: A mother says the bodies are those of her daughter and niece.
Two bodies have been found in Iowa near where two girls disappeared in July.
The bodies were headed to the state medical examiner for identification.
"It's looking like the outcome was not the one that we wanted," sheriff's deputy says.
