Christopher Iruke, 61, was the pastor at a now-defunct L.A. church.
He also ran medical supply companies, paying for illicit prescriptions and documents.
He submitted $14.2 million in fraudulent claims and got $6.7 million in reimbursements.
He was convicted in August, along with his wife, one other conspirator.
