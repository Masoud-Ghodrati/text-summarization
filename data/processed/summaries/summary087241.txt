Atlanta Athletic Club will host U.S. PGA Championship for the third time this week.
It was the home club of golf legend Bobby Jones, who broke records 80 years ago.
Jones is the only golfer to win all four major tournaments in one calendar year.
After retiring in 1930 he built Augusta National and founded the Masters Tournament.
