Urooj Khan, 46, won $1 million before taxes on an Illinois lottery scratch ticket.
He died suddenly weeks later; authorities first ruled his death "natural".
Revisiting the case, they found he died of "cyanide toxicity," a medical examiner says.
Chicago police are investigating, but haven't made any arrests.
