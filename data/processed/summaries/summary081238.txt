In a study by Dr. Robert Bolli, 16 patients with heart failure received stem cell therapy.
Within a year, the heart function of the patients in the study markedly improved.
"We were surprised by the magnitude of improvement," says Bolli.
"We would possibly be curing heart failure. It would be a revolution," says Bolli.
