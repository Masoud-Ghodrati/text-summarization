Claims Hong Kong's leader received millions of dollars from Australian company.
Money was paid while C.Y. Leung was in office, yet he didn't declare it.
Contract signed in December 2011 before Leung was appointed chief executive.
Leung's office said it was a "standard non-poach, non-compete arrangement".
