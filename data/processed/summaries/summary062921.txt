Two Amish girls were kidnapped -- and later found -- in upstate New York last month.
Nicole Vaisey and Stephen Howells II were arrested.
Prosecutors say the couple conspired to "sexually exploit" the girls and a third victim.
The five-count indictment includes one child pornography charge against Howells.
