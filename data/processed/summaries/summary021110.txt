China releases a map and coordinates that identify its "Air Defense Identification Zone".
The zone includes disputed islands -- known as Senkaku by Japan and Diaoyu by China.
China began air patrols over the zone on Saturday.
Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel called the move is an attempt to destabilize the status quo in the region.
