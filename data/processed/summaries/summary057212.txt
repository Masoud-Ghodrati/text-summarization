After a bully bothered Biden's sister, he "smashed his head next to the counter" and threatened to kill him.
The point of the story was that Biden stood up for his sister and his father was proud of him for it.
The remarks came at an event where Biden was recognized for being a man who combats violence against women.
The vice president, who grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania, had a history of fighting as a child.
