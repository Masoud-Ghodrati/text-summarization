NEW: At least two winning tickets were sold, one in California and one in Georgia.
The winning numbers are 8, 20, 14, 17 and 39, with a Megaball of 7.
The jackpot is so large in part because Mega Millions' odds rose with more numbers in play.
The jackpot is close to the record $656 million prize that was split in 2012.
