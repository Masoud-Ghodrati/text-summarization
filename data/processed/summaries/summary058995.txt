A victim leader and union leaders attend a memorial marking the 2004 bombing anniversary.
Some criticize unions for holding nationwide protests over labor reforms on the same day.
The protest "absolutely does not bother us," says Pilar Manjon, whose son was killed in attacks.
Some ceremonies are moved to Monday because of the union demonstrations.
