The entire board of the under-fire Jamaican Anti-Doping Commission resigns.
The resignations come after several sprinters failed drug tests this year.
Those caught included the high-profile pair of Veronica Campbell-Brown and Asafa Powell.
A former head of the commission said few drug tests were carried out in early 2012.
