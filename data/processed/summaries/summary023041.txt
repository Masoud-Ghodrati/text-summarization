Peter Feldstein set out in 1984 to photograph everyone in Iowa town.
He then rephotographed them 20 years later and recorded their oral histories.
Feldstein's colleague Stephen Bloom: "My job in Oxford was to talk to the voiceless".
Resident: "There were things in there that the gossip line didn't know about!".
