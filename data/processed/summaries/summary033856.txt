FIFA award licenses to goal-line technology developers GoalRef and Hawk-Eye.
World soccer's lawmakers approved the use of goal-line technology in July.
Hawk-Eye is already used in tennis and cricket; GoalRef developed by a German company.
The technology will be used for the first time at the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan.
