Andrei Filatov, chess expert and Russian billionaire, is turning his hand to a new business.
He is scouting the world for artworks done during the Soviet Union-era.
The era's socialist realism genre has been enjoying a renaissance.
Filatov wants to collect up to 12 new artworks a year and promote them globally.
