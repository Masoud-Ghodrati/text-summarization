Facebook's Timeline profile layout is now available to all users.
You can organize friends into lists. Facebook Lists rolled out in September.
On your Timeline, click "Activity Log," where you'll find posts and info to review.
Click the pencil icon at the top of an offending post, then choose "Hide from Timeline".
