Abu Qatada was convicted in absentia of terror-related charges in Jordan.
British official says Jordan will quash that conviction and retry him.
Abu Qatada is also accused of funding terrorist groups and inspiring a 9/11 hijacker.
He has said deportation would put him at risk of torture and lengthy pretrial detention.
