NEW: Crews begin pulling wreckage from Skagit River, a CNN affiliate reports.
A truck driver told investigators the first sign of a problem was a ''boom''.
The truck was following a pilot car that was to notify it of potential hazards, the NTSB says.
The NTSB identified the truck driver only as 41-year-old male with 20 years' experience.
