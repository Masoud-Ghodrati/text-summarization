Philosophy professor Natalia Juarez is running for congress in Mexico.
Her campaign includes a billboard on which she and other women are topless.
The candidate says it's her way of giving voters a wake-up call with radical ideas for Mexico.
"Even if I dressed as a nun ... conservatives are never going to vote for me," she says.
