A law in Canberra, Australia, allowing same-sex marriage is declared invalid.
A court says a federal act, which doesn't permit same-sex marriage, takes precedence.
Activists say the decision is "devastating" for the couples who got married.
They vow to lobby the national parliament to change federal legislation.
