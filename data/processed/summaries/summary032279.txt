Jyllands Park Zoo says there's no plan to kill one of its male giraffes, named Marius.
There is no plan to send a female giraffe to the zoo for a breeding plan, the zoo says.
A petition set up to save the Jyllands Park Zoo giraffe has more than 10,000 signatures.
Last weekend Copenhagen Zoo killed a giraffe, also named Marius, to prevent in-breeding.
