Under proposed rules, Boy Scouts would not exclude youths for sexual orientation.
The Scouts would maintain a ban on openly gay adult leaders under the proposal.
The proposal is expected to be presented to the Boy Scouts' voting members in May.
If the policy is approved, it would take effect at the start of 2014.
