CNN Hero helps partner service dogs with people with wide range of disabilities.
Since 1998, Karen Shirk's nonprofit 4 Paws for Ability has placed 319 dogs.
Nearly 70 percent of the dogs have been partnered with autistic children.
She started the program after being told she was too disabled for a service dog.
