Women's rights groups are angry over remarks by Turkish President.
Erdogan says women and men are not equal "because their nature is different".
Women need "to be equivalent, rather than equal," he says, saying they cannot do all jobs.
Rights groups accuse Erdogan of trying to erode rights attained by women decades ago.
