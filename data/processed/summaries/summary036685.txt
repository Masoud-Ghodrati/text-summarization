NEW: "I don't even think I threw a no-hitter in video games," Johan Santana says.
The feat leaves the San Diego Padres as the only team without a no-hitter.
"I'm very happy, and happy for you guys -- finally the first one," he says to Mets fans.
Santana won two Cy Young Awards as a Minnesota Twin before coming to New York.
