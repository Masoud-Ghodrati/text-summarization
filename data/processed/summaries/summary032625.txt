Chris Brown is three years into his five years of probation for the 2009 assault on Rihanna.
Brown travels to Trinidad, an island close to Rihanna's native Barbados this month, his lawyer says.
The singer has completed his community labor and other probation requirements, the judge says.
His probation has been transferred from his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, to Los Angeles.
