LZ Granderson: Brad Paisley's song "Accidental Racist" provokes criticism.
Granderson: It was brave of Paisley to try to address racial issues in country music.
He says that "Accidental" raises provocative questions, but Paisley did it awkwardly.
Granderson: If we're going to usher in more tolerance, we have to allow for "mistakes".
