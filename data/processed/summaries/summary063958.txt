EU research project is looking at feasibility of small commuter air vehicles.
Called 'MyCopter', it aims to consider all the issues surrounding personal aviation vehicles.
Challenges include air traffic systems, crash avoidance technology and accessibility.
The project hopes to have a commuter air vehicle commercially available by 2050.
