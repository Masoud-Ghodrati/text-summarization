A man allegedly rams his car into a Ten Commandments monument.
The 6-foot granite copy of the Biblical edicts has drawn criticism from a civil rights group.
The ACLU still wants the monument gone -- but legally; it condemns the apparent vandalism.
The Satanic Temple also condemned the monument's destruction as violation of free speech.
