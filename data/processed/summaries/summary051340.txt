Former workers at a California slaughterhouse have been indicted.
They are accused of distributing "adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected" meat.
Prosecutors allege that the workers processed cows with signs of "cancer eye".
Authorities recalled nearly 9 million pounds of meat from the slaughterhouse in February.
