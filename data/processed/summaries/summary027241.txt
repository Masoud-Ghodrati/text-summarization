Four Americans missionaries were released Saturday after being detained a few days ago.
Not clear if this is related to detained Americans mentioned by Venezuelan President Maduro.
Maduro also banned George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, others from entering Venezuela.
Venezuela will now require Americans to get a visa to visit.
