Brett Cummins resigned Friday from his job as a meteorologist at KARK, his lawyer says.
Given all the inquiries to KARK, Cummins "thought it ... best" if he quit, adds the attorney.
He was found in a tub one week ago alongside a dead body, according to a police report.
No one has been arrested, and lawyer says he hopes inquiry will clear his client.
