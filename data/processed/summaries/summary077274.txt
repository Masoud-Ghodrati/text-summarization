NEW: U.S. regulators Wednesday ordered airlines to stop flying their Boeing 787s.
Two fleets of Boeing 787s have been grounded in Japan after one jet made an emergency landing.
The woes come after the debut of the plane in 2011, nearly three years behind its production schedule.
About 50 aircraft have been delivered; Boeing has more than 800 unfilled orders from airlines.
