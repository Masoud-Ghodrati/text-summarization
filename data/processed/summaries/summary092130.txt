The government is moving to revoke the ferry operator's business licenses.
Cheonghaejin Marine Company operated the ferry that sank last month off the South Korean coast.
Authorities have arrested the company's chief executive; he faces charges including causing death by negligence.
Searchers have recovered 269 bodies from the sunken ferry; another 35 people remain missing.
