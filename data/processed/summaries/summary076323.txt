Pope Benedict XVI delivered his final Angelus prayer and blessing Sunday.
He will step down as pontiff on Thursday, retire into a life of meditation and prayer.
Benedict insists his departure from the papacy "does not mean abandoning the Church".
Instead he says he will continue to serve "in a way adapted to my age and my strength".
