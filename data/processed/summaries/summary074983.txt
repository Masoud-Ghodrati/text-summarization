John Yettaw: Made the trip to Yangon to save Suu Kyi from assassination.
Said he had no idea pro-democracy leader would be arrested and put on trial.
Yettaw had swam uninvited to Suu Kyi's house and stayed for three days.
The visit to her home violated her house arrest terms, Myanmar government says.
