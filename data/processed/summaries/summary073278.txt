An island 10 miles off Scotland is the sole place to supply Olympic curling stones.
It has provided each and every stone for all the climactic finishes to recent Olympics.
The island is for sale for anyone with a cool $2.5 million to spare.
Nature conservation group has tabled an offer to buy it from the Marquess of Ailsa Craig.
