Tower Bridge in London is being retrofitted with LED light bulbs that will reduce its energy consumption by 40%.
The project will be completed by the start of the 2012 Olympics, which are aiming to be the greenest ever.
Other famous buildings to be retrofitted with green technology include Sydney Opera House and the Empire State Building.
