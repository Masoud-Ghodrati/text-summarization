Catherine Kieu, 50, is sentenced to life with possibility of parole after seven years.
She was convicted of severing her then-husband's penis, putting it in a garbage disposal.
The husband filed for divorce two months before the July 2011 incident.
"She has torn off my identity as a man," ex-husband says during sentencing.
