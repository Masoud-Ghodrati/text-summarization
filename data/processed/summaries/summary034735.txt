A 1-mile stretch of Linden Avenue will be named after the civil rights leader.
Ceremony will take place on April 4, the 44th anniversary of King's death.
It was on this street that King led a march in support of striking sanitation workers.
"We wanted something that had a real nexus to this city," says Mayor A.C. Wharton.
