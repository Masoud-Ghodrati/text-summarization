Footage from cameras due to be fitted to the space station will be streamed on the Internet.
UrtheCast says the video data could be used to help in the wake of disasters.
The company president Scott Larson argues that video from the space station will be less of an invasion of privacy than current CCTV networks.
Urthecast also says its cameras will capture an area of the globe so large that it contains the majority of the world's population.
