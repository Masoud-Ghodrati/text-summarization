Ehud Olmert says extreme right-wing elements in the United States helped derail his peace plan.
They poured millions of dollars into efforts to topple him from office, he says.
Olmert, who quit as prime minister amid corruption allegations, does not name the right-wing figures.
His 2008 peace plan proposed a two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.
