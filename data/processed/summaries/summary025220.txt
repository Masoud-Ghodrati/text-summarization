Police: Reza Sadeghnia pleaded guilty in plot to kill an Iranian-American dissident.
He was allowed to return to Iran, but his deadline to return to U.S. passed months ago.
WikiLeaks cable: He had been linked to a previous plot involving a London dissident.
Sadeghnia's would-be target believes he was let go in a prisoner swap with Iran.
