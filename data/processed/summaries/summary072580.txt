Gruber called voters stupid, the GOP is calling him the Obamacare architect, and Dems are calling it all a misunderstanding.
Gruber played a crucial role in crafting the law and its Massachusetts model, but isn't "the architect" of the law.
Gruber's "stupid" comments came as he explained the lack of transparency in selling the law to have it pass.
The GOP is using this to prove voters were misled and Democrats are trying to distance themselves from Gruber.
