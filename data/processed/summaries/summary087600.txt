Jean Claude Mas and four others are on trial in France over controversial breast implants.
Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, is accused of causing involuntary injury.
PIP implants were banned in 2010, and the company went bankrupt later that year.
Mas has consistently denied any wrongdoing and says his products were safe.
