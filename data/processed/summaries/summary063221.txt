A sniper's bullet in Iraq left Staff Sgt. Matthew Keil paralyzed.
His wife, Tracy, works around the clock to care for him.
They are waiting for a law that will provide money and training for wounded vets' caregivers.
Until the law takes effect, Tracy says "it's like I'm working for the VA for free".
