1,200 bottles from the wine cellar of the Élysée Palace are being auctioned off.
The money will pay for new, "more modest" bottles to be bought, says the auction house.
Any extra funds will be poured into the state budget, it says.
The presidential wine cellar, set up in 1947, showcases some of France's finest vintages.
