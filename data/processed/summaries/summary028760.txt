Assemblyman says governor's office asked him to attend announcement of bill.
Previous governor filed same bill, which passed Assembly but not Senate.
Gov. Paterson has said he is committed to "full marriage equality in New York State".
"We hope to have this bill passed at the end of June," assemblyman says.
