Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has resigned from Egypt's armed forces to run for president.
Adel El-Adawy says el-Sisi enjoys the support of the state and of the street.
El-Sisi's presidencial bid is strengthened by the support of Egypt's Gulf allies, he says.
But El-Adawy says el-Sisi's success as president would still depend on his ability to deliver.
