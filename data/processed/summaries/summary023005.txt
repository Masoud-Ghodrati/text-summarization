Ronny Poluan leads tours of a Jakarta slum to show visitors the 'real' capital.
Tours cost about $34 -- half of that goes to Poluan, the other half to the locals.
Some critics say the tours exploit the poor and teach them to rely on handouts.
Tour covers a market, soy bean cake and tofu factories, meeting residents.
