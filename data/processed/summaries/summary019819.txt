Most young people with uveitis, a rare disease, also have juvenile arthritis.
Only about one out of 10 kids with arthritis also develop the disease in their eyes.
If not treated early, uveitis can damage vision and in some cases lead to blindness.
Early diagnosis and treatment with biologic drugs, such as Enbrel, can control swelling.
