Nineteen people --mainly foreign tourists -- died in a ballooning disaster in Luxor on Tuesday.
Egypt's international tourism industry has been negatively affected by the 2011 revolution.
Analysts say that figures for 2012 showed there had been a slight recovery in the industry.
They say the ballooning disaster is a blow to Egyptian efforts to grow tourism.
