Samuel Kent says he lied about nonconsensual sexual contact with 2 employees.
Kent submits resignation effective June 2010, which allowed him to collect salary.
To keep Kent from being paid while in jail, House panel votes to impeach.
Decision on whether he'll lose his seat on the bench and pension rests with Senate.
