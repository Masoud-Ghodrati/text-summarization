Chelsea defender Ashley Cole is charged with misconduct by English Football Association.
Cole sent an abusive tweet about the FA after he was criticised in a report on racism.
Independent probe into John Terry racism claims said Cole's evidence "evolved" over time.
Cole called the FA a "bunch of twats" upon hearing the findings of the report.
