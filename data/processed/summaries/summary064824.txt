Chansa Kabwela wanted to highlight conditions in which women were being forced to give birth during a hospital strike.
She mailed pictures to government ministers of a woman delivering a baby in a hospital parking lot.
Zambian President Rupiah Banda described the photos as pornographic and Kabwela was ordered arrested.
