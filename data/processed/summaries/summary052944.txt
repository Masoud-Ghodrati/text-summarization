Former head chef of Spain's elBulli, is launching a new venture.
Ferran Adria's elBulli Foundation will include a search engine of gastronomy and visitor center.
Adria says he's come up with a "theory of everything" ... a model to unlock creativity in any walk of life.
His "creativity map" outlines the process that takes an idea from inspiration to finished product.
