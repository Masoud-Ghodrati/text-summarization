Dominique Strauss-Kahn was investigated over sex parties at the Hotel Carlton in Lille.
Strauss-Khan, a 64-year-old economist, has denied wrongdoing.
He stepped down as IMF chief in 2011 after sex charges were filed in New York.
New York prosecutors dropped that case because of questions over his accuser's credibility.
