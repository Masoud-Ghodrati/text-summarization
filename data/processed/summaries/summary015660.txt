NEW: Trayvon Martin's mom: It's "devastating" to hear Juror B29's comments.
"The law couldn't prove" that Zimmerman was guilty, a juror tells ABC.
"George Zimmerman got away with murder, but you can't get away from God," she says.
Juror B29 says "we had to grab our hearts and put it aside and look at the evidence".
