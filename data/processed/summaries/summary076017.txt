Photographer Jennifer Loomis felt the photos of foster children didn't do them justice.
She and another photographer convened a free photo shoot to capture better photos.
Deon, 16, was one of seven foster children who took part in the special shoot.
Nearly 400,000 children were in foster care as of November 2013.
