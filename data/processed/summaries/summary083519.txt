Scotland is holding a referendum on independence on September 18.
Voters will face a yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?".
A poll on Sunday for the first time suggested that the "yes" campaign had the edge.
YouGov says that reflects a statistical dead heat; other polls also suggest "yes" is gaining.
