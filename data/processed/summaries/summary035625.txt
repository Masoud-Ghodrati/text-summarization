Hiroo Onoda wouldn't accept Japan's World War II defeat until 1974.
He stayed in the jungle on the Philippines island where he had been deployed.
His former commanding officer had to travel to the island to persuade him to give up.
Onoda died of pneumonia in a Tokyo hospital Thursday, a collegue says.
