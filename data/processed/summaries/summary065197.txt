NEW: A PLO official accuses Hamas of sabotaging efforts for U.N. status as a non-member state.
Hamas protesters say President Abbas abandoned a demand for a "right of return".
Abbas says he did not, and that he was only speaking for himself.
Israeli PM Netanyahu says if Abbas is serious, peace talks could start today.
