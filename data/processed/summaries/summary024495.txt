Tim Stanley says Catholic contraception dust-up cast by some as new culture war.
Stanley says this may work in GOP primaries, but it won't with today's general voters.
He says social issues Pat Buchanan touted in 1992 don't resonate in bad economy.
Stanley: "War" is more relevant to political elites than voters and won't help GOP in election.
