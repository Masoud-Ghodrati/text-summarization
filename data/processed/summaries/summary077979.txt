NEW: Palestinian security forces say they will investigate the allegations.
The Human Rights Watch report focuses on seven incidents in the West Bank and two in Gaza.
Journalists were "tortured, beat, and arbitrarily detained," the report says.
The rift between Fatah and Hamas is behind most of the incidents, it says.
