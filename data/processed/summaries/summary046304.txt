An explosion ripped apart a Kansas City, Missouri, restaurant last month.
Pilot lights inside the restaurant's kitchen ignited the gas, a new government report says.
The blast came after a gas line was ruptured nearby by a person laying cable.
One woman died after getting trapped when the restaurant's roof collapsed.
