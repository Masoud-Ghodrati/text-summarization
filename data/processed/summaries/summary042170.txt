Scott Dekraai's attorney says he is considering a change of venue request.
Prosecutors file eight first-degree murder charges and one attempted murder count.
Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against Dekraai, of Huntington Beach.
Authorities say Dekraai and his ex-wife, among the killed, were fighting over custody of a son.
