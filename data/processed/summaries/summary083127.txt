Mohammed Ayoob: Muslim Brotherhood lost half its support between the two elections.
The Brotherhood can't govern by itself with support of only 22% of electorate, he writes.
Ayoob: Mubarak-linked candidate did well, but social justice proponent did well, too.
Liberals, Nasserists and Brotherhood must form their own coalition, Ayoob writes.
