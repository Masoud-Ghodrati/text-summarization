Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser is among those dealing with the spill.
"A year later, I can't look you in the eye and tell you who's in charge," he says.
Oil continues to hit the shores of Louisiana, Nungesser tells CNN's Eliot Spitzer.
"We need full disclosure by BP and the Coast Guard, so this never happens again".
