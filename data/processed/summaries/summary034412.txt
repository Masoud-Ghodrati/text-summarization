Siblings Chance Tubane and Patience Nduwawe are the founders of Tohoza.com.
The online classified ad directory is Rwanda's third most popular website.
The two siblings were separated for nearly 10 years in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide.
They say their main objective is to provide a positive image about their country.
