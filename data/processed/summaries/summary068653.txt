A North Dakota abortion law was supposed to go into effect Thursday.
Its requirements would have led to the closure of the state's only abortion clinic.
Clinic's past doesn't suggest new regulations are needed; judge halts law's implementation.
The clinic's director cheers the ruling, saying state constitution protects abortion rights.
