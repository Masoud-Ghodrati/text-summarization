CNN's Ben Wedeman says there's little enthusiasm in Gaza for the flare-up with Israel.
He says Hamas is defiant but in private many Palestinians are opposed to their leadership.
Israel's anti-Hamas rhetoric intensified after Hamas reached a pact with Fatah, he says.
There's been no sign of urgency in the international community to become involved, he says.
