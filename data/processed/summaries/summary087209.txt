Richard Holbrooke: "It's clear" Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud is dead.
Mehsud would be on TV and radio if he were alive, U.S. envoy says.
Taliban has given conflicting reports about whether Mehsud killed in missile strike.
One Taliban spokesman says Mehsud is ill and will reappear when he feels better.
