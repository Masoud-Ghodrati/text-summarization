We pit "MLB 11 The Show" against "MLB2K11" in a nine-inning contest.
Both games do a great job rendering realistic major league players and parks.
Each game allows you to create a fictional player and take them from AA to the Hall of Fame.
It was close, but one of the games emerged as our favorite.
