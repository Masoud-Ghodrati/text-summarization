LZ: Mozilla CEO resigned after firestorm over 2008 donation to anti-same-sex marriage Prop 8.
He says this is less a free speech issue than a poor move in the first place by Mozilla board.
Far more in U.S., particularly millennials (Mozilla's consumers) are pro-gay marriage than in 2008.
LZ: Mozilla should have planned how it would handle the inevitable backlash over Eich.
