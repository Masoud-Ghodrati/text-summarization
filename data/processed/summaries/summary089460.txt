Soccer star Pele will be re-evaluated Monday to see if he needs to go back on dialysis.
He went to a hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil, last week for a urinary tract infection.
The hospital says the 74-year-old is getting better as he's being treated in the ICU.
Pele is a three-time World Cup champion and shared Player of the Century award.
