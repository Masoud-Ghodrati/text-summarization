Sen. John McCain urged Attorney General Eric Holder for a "fair and timely" end to the investigation into David Petraeus.
The Justice Department's two-year-old investigation followed Petraeus's resignation in 2012, citing an affair.
McCain says the investigation could lead to Petraeus's voice being "silenced or curtailed".
