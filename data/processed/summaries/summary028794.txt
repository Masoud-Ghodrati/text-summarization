William Balfour gets 3 life sentences without parole, plus 120 years.
The sentence is fitting given the "inhumane nature" of the killings, prosecutor says.
Balfour was convicted of killing the entertainer's mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew.
Prosecutors portrayed him as a jealous man who murdered the three in a rage.
