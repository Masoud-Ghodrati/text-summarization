Hollywood star Samuel L. Jackson plays golf as a hobby and to raise funds for charity.
The 64-year-old played with Tiger Woods at the St. Andrew's course in Scotland.
Augusta National, home of the Masters, is Jackson's favorite golf course.
Jackson has a clause in his film contracts which gives him time off to play golf.
