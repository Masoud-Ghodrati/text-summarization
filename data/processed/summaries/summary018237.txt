100,000 attendees a day are expected to visit Lollapalooza this weekend.
The fest has grown in size, but founder Perry Farrell hopes after-parties will offer intimacy.
Headliners include The Black Keys and Jack White.
Farrell: "We're taking it up a notch, and we're taking it to four in the morning".
