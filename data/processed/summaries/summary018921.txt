NEW: Heavy gunfire erupts at Syria-Lebanon border, official Lebanese news agency says.
No new weapons will be delivered "until the situation stabilizes," says Russian official.
Russia has been the long-time principal supplier of arms to Syria.
Kofi Annan says he will take "an approach" agreed to by al-Assad to the opposition.
