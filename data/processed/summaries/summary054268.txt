An arrest warrant was issued for Jesse Helt in 2011, a corrections official says.
Helt stopped checking in with probation officer after criminal trespass conviction, he says.
Cyrus: "You've chosen to go after Jesse instead of covering" the youth homelessness issue.
Helt could spend a year in jail for his probation violation, the official says.
