President Obama's campaign launches a fictional storybook ad called "The Life of Julia".
William Bennett: Buried within the ad is the ideological vision of modern liberalism.
He says the story of Julia represents Obama's view of the state's role in an individual's life.
Bennett: Conservatives must be able to craft an alternative vision.
