Marc Rotenberg: Germany levied small fine on Google for gathering people's private info.
Fine was less than $200,000. Google made $10 billion in 2010. Fine has no teeth, he says.
Public agencies failing to strengthen laws on companies that threaten privacy, he says.
Rotenberg: Proposed Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights a good step toward enforcement.
