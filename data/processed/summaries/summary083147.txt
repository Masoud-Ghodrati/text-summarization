National Transportation Safety Board concerned about near misses during aborted landings.
Board says standards inadequate, recommends FAA improve aircraft separation.
Incidents, four last year, occurred in Las Vegas, New York and Charlotte.
Safety issue arises when planes scrub landing and then pull up to circle airport.
