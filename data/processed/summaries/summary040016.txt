Whitney Houston's death rocks the music industry on the eve of its biggest night.
Her death, at age 48, was the final chapter of the storied career that began in the 1980s.
Houston's career stalled as her drug use and marriage to Bobby Brown made for tabloid fodder.
She was working to turn her career around with a star turn in the upcoming film, "Sparkle".
