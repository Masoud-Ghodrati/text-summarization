A number of sightings of Eric Frein have been reported in rural Pennsylvania.
The long manhunt is wearing thin on some residents of Pike and Monroe counties.
Frein, a self-styled survivalist, is believed to be hiding in the woods.
He is accused of killing one Pennsylvania state police officer and shooting another.
