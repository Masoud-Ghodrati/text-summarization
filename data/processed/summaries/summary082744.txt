Heptathlete Jessica Ennis says she won't visit Olympic Stadium until it is time to compete.
The UK athlete wants her first trip to provide her with extra adrenalin to help her win gold.
Ennis won gold at the World Championships in 2009 but had to settle for silver in 2011.
The London Games will be her first Olympics after injury forced her to miss Beijing in 2008.
