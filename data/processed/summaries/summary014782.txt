Steven Noel Perkins traded Brent crude futures contracts without client authorization.
His trading pushed the price up to $73.50 a barrel -- the highest this year.
The FSA said the trading seems to have been a result of "extremely heavy drinking".
Perkins was also fined Â£72,000 ($108,400) for market abuse.
