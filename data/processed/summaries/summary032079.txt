10 former players launch a class-action lawsuit against National Hockey League.
Players say the league has not done enough to protect players from concussion.
Former NHL All-Star Gary Leema is one of the 10 players taking the action.
NHL says it will "defend the case vigorously" and that it takes player safety "very seriously".
