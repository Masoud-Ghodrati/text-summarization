Sermon at Sen. Barack Obama's church took aim at Sen. Hillary Clinton.
The Rev. Michael Pfleger said Clinton cried because she felt entitled to presidency.
Obama says he's "deeply disappointed" by what he calls a "divisive" sermon.
Pfleger apologizes, says his words were inconsistent with Obama's message.
