Michael Dunn is convicted on three counts of attempted second-degree murder.
But there's a mistrial on first-degree murder; prosecutors say they'll seek a new trial.
Dunn faces 60 years in prison, possibly 15 more for another charge.
The teen killed, Jordan Davis, would have celebrated his 19th birthday Sunday.
