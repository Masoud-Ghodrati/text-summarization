New York's Ellis Island hospital complex is now open to the public for tours.
Immigrants were stopped at the hospital and checked for disease between 1902 and 1930.
French artist JR has placed life-sized images of former doctors and patients on its walls.
The complex is a mix of hope and pain, the gateway to a new life and world.
