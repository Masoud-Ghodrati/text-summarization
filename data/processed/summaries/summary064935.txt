NEW: A person alerted police after recognizing the missing boys on CNN, police say.
Daniel Cleary failed to return his sons as planned and hadn't been heard from.
An Amber Alert went out Thursday; the boys' mother pleaded Saturday for their return.
"It is amazing. I had lost hope," their mother says, shortly after talking to her sons.
