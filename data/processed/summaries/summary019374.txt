Hotel Indigo in England may be the first to replace bedside Bibles with Kindles.
Gideons International, which gives out 84 million Bibles a year, supports the project.
A Bible costs Gideons $5 to print and distribute; a Kindle in the UK costs about $139.
Stolen Kindles will be charged to the guest's credit card.
