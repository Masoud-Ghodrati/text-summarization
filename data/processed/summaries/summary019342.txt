The GAO says about 4,500 registered sex offenders received U.S. passports in fiscal year 2008.
At least 30 federal employees who are registered sex offenders obtained U.S. passports.
The State Department can only deny passports to those convicted of sex tourism.
The State Department says GAO report has "more 'shock value' than factual accuracy".
