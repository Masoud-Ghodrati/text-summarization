When he was a boy in Australia, Terence Tao says, he loved games, puzzles, math problems.
Once he realized that math could answer questions about the world, he was hooked, he says.
At 16 he came to U.S. to study for Ph.D; split life between U.S. and Australia; married in U.S..
Tao: I'm husband, dad, citizen of both countries now, but my identity is as a mathematician.
