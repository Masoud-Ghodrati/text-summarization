Paul Ryan and Russ Feingold are two policy wonks who grew up in Janesville, Wisconsin.
Alan Borsuk says the two have very different political views but share key attributes.
He says they, along with many in Wisconsin, want politics to be about big ideas and issues.
Borsuk: Ryan may not bring Romney to victory in Wisconsin, but the race has tightened.
