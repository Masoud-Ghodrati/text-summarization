Cynthia Nixon says when she was young, she dreaded talking about sex with her parents.
She eventually did (her parents were open with her), and values that, now that she's a parent.
October is Let's Talk Month; parents, make sure you talk to your kids about sex, she says.
Nixon: Kids get information online; parents and schools must correct misinformation.
