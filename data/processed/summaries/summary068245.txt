Spain's proposed abortion law would restrict abortion to rape victims or women who would suffer lasting harm.
It would effectively reverse a 2010 law allowing abortion on request for the first 14 weeks.
Ann Furedi says Spanish woman would have to travel to other countries for terminations.
Furedi says women should be able to make a decision in line with their own moral values.
