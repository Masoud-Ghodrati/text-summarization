U.S.-backed Syrian rebels have been ousted from their strongholds, monitors say.
Reports say moderates, pressured by family, have defected to al-Nusra.
There are concerns that al-Nusra might target a key crossing at the Turkish border.
Like ISIS, al-Nusra Front is trying to establish an Islamic state, though primarily in Syria.
