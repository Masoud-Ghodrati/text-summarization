Timothy Stanley: Brandeis withdrew honorary degree offer to Islam critic Ayaan Hirsi Ali.
He says move runs counter to academic freedom, Brandeis shouldn't have withdrawn it.
Had university vetted her, it would have seen her views on Islam are narrow, he says.
Stanley: Hirsi Ali's views are deemed politically incorrect for good reason.
