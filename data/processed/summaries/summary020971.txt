The Philippines sends a naval vessel to a lagoon in the South China Sea.
It says Chinese fishing boats in the lagoon had illegally collected corals and fish.
Chinese surveillance ships arrive at the scene and block the entry to the lagoon.
Both countries claim the area is "an integral part" of their territory.
