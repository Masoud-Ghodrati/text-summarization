Thomas Mann: GOP talking point is that the House reflects Americans' views.
He says that's wrong: Obamacare is law; attempts to nullify it violate the Constitution.
Mann: GOP in House lost 2012 overall popular vote but kept control because of redistricting.
He says House can press its views but not recklessly threaten U.S., global economy.
