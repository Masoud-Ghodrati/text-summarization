Milton Hall was killed in a confrontation with police in Saginaw, Michigan.
"It appeared to be a firing squad dressed in police uniforms," his mother says.
Prosecutors and state police are investigating Hall's killing.
His family says he was mentally ill and questions why the probe is taking so long.
