Donna Brazile: Pope Francis has reoriented the church to stress humility, forgiveness.
She says critics who say the new film "Philomena" is anti-Catholic are wrong.
Film tells story of woman's effort to forgive people who treated her cruelly, she says.
Brazile: It's not anti-Catholic to question or to talk about failings of the past.
