Amateur video apparently shows a Saudi man berating and beating a migrant worker.
The man appears to be angry because he thinks the worker has spoken to his wife.
Saudi government-backed Human Rights Commission says it's investigating the video.
Rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.
