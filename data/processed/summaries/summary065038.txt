Harrison Ford appeared at Comic-Con to discuss his new film "Ender's Game".
The film is based on the award-winning 1985 novel by Orson Scott Card.
Card has generated attention for his comments against same-sex marriage.
Ford called his "Ender's Game" character "more complex" than "Star Wars" icon Han Solo.
