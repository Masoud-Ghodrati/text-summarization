The Ivory Coast is the world's top supplier of cocoa, producing 35 percent of global supplies.
After increased cocoa production in the 1990s, production has flat-lined in the past 10 years.
Political instability has delayed investment in the Ivory Coast's cocoa industry.
Other challenges include lack of credit and a shift among Ivorian farmers away from cocoa to more reliable crops.
