Bob Greene: The Dantes were local band which seemed bound for big time.
This summer he saw Dantes singer playing with new band, The Professors, in an Ohio bar.
Dantes didn't make big time, split up and singer Barry Hayden worked at different jobs.
Greene: But Hayden was back performing, doing thing he loved. That should be mandatory.
