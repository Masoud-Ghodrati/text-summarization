A 4,000-year-old Egyptian sphinx was an unexpected find in an Israel excavation site, Tel Hazor.
Only the paws have been found so far, and the piece bears the name of a pharaoh who ruled in 2500 BC.
The normally quiet part of Israel is enlivened every summer when archeologists and volunteers arrive to dig.
Excavations first began in the 1950s, and numerous artifacts and documents have been unearthed.
