Delta has added a spending requirement to elite frequent flier status.
The bottom rung of its Medallion program will require $2,500 annually in ticket purchases.
Some fliers will be bumped down or out of the program because of the spending rule.
The move increases the odds of upgrades for fliers who qualify, mileage analyst says.
