Elias Abuelazam declined to change his plea at a second hearing.
He is linked to 18 stabbings in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio, police say.
Authorities say he was in custody twice before they knew he was a suspect.
He was arrested this week at the airport in Atlanta on suspicion of killing five people.
