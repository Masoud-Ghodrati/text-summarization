Glenn Beck, conservative media host, thinks Hillary Clinton "will be the next president".
"She is going to win," Beck said with confidence.
He argued Clinton can convince Americans she will take the country back to Bill Clinton's administration.
Republicans are too focused on Reagan, Beck said, and will be unable to overcome Clinton's message.
