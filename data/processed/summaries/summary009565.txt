Paul Chambers was originally fined Â£385 ($603) for sending a "menacing tweet".
The case has highlighted the arguments about the limits of free speech on the internet.
The UK court ruled that the tweet was treated and addressed as if it was not a credible threat.
High profile comics sent messages supporting the Chambers' appeal.
