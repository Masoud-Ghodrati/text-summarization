A couple is alleged to have held three women captive in London for more than 30 years.
Police arrested the pair Thursday but later released them on bail until January.
On Saturday police said the couple were of Tanzanian and Indian origin.
Two of the victims appeared to have met the man through 'a shared political ideology'.
