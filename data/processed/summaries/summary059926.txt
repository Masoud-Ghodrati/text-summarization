U.S. Supreme Court issues stay of execution for Henry "Hank" Skinner.
Skinner, 47, was to be executed by lethal injection Wednesday.
He was convicted of murdering his girlfriend and her two sons in 1993 in Pampa, Texas.
Skinner's attorneys say DNA testing of the evidence could establish his innocence.
