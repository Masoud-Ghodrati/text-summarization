NEW: Carville says Democrats are "furious" at Weiner, whose wife has ties to the Clintons.
The New York Democrat says he will cooperate with an ethics probe called by Nancy Pelosi.
Weiner says he "lied because he was ashamed" and "didn't want to get caught".
He says he had inappropriate relationships with several women he'd met online.
