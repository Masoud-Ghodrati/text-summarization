Police say two-thirds of a huge cache of stolen maple syrup has been recovered.
It was snatched from a Quebec storage facility between August 2011 and July 2012.
Five others are being sought in connection with the crime.
Police say they seized vehicles that carried the syrup, as well as carts, lifts, scales and kettles.
