NEW: Philae's operators satisfied that the probe completed its mission on the comet.
Philae's landing didn't go as planned, leaving it in the shade, ESA says.
It is supposed to run on solar power, but now there's not enough sunlight for that.
Philae's primary battery was running out and is expected to be dead.
