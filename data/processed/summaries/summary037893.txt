Gen. David Petraeus has been tapped to head the CIA.
CIA Director Leon Panetta has been nominated to lead the Defense Department.
Petraeus will provide much-needed leadership for an agency more heavily involved in military missions.
Panetta will likely help oversee an era of declining Pentagon budgets and fewer large-scale conflicts.
