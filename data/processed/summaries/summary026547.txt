William Bennett: Jeffress' comments about Romney's faith hurt presidential race.
Jeffress, a Perry supporter, said Romney is not a Christian and Mormonism is a cult.
Bennett says we must reject religious, and racial, bigotry; politics are about policy.
There is no religious test for public office and it's a matter of political principles, he says.
