China's biggest meat brand, Shuanghui, has tainted food history since 2011.
Poison, maggots, bacteria allegedly in company products, say Chinese state-run media.
Shuanghui bid to acquire U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, world's largest pork processor.
USDA confirms to CNN it will still regulate Smithfield products if merger successful.
