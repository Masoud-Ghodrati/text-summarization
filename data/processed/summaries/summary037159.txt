CNN Latino targets the growing and diverse U.S. Hispanic market, delivering a broad spectrum of programming.
"The U.S. market is so diverse and so large that there is room for two distinctive content options," said CNN executive.
There is a company-wide initiative at CNN to produce more content for the U.S. Hispanic audience.
This will be CNN en Espa√±ol's first attempt in creating an alternative programming block for broadcast Spanish-language TV.
