CNN's Janet Ahn traveled to Haiti to witness the earthquake devastation and help rebuild.
Ahn met Miriam Frederick, who has been volunteering in Haiti for the past 30 years.
Frederick helps care for Lavita, 8, suffering from malnutrition after living in tent city.
Seeing Lavita's recovery encourages volunteers to continue working.
