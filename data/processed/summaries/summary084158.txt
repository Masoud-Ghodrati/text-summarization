Protesters rally in Central African Republic capital against international peacekeepers.
They are angry the force has not done more to stop deadly attacks in Bangui.
Civilians have also clashed with peacekeepers in the town of Bambari.
Christians and Muslims in Bambari co-existed peacefully until last week; now town is split.
