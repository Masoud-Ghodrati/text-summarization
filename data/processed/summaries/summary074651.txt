The U.S. Senate considers imposing punitive tariffs on China for allegedly manipulating the RMB.
U.S. President Barack Obama said China is manipulating its currency but expressed concerns about backing the bill.
China opposes the bill, warning it "seriously violates rules of the World Trade Organization and obstructs China-U.S. trade ties".
