NEW: Myanmar plans to release 651 prisoners starting Friday, state television reports.
If the cease-fire holds, it will end 63 years of bloody conflict.
Myanmar has historically accused the Karen of waging attacks to destabilize the military junta.
Karen activists said it was too early to gauge whether peace would hold.
