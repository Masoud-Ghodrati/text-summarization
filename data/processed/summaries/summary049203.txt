Lindsay Sandiford was sentenced to death in Bali for smuggling cocaine.
The prosecutor had only asked for a 15-year prison term, so the sentence was unexpected.
Sandiford would have been an "attractive target" for "threats," Jacinta Jones writes.
The Reprieve lawyer argues the case will tarnish Bali's reputation more than the Briton's actions.
