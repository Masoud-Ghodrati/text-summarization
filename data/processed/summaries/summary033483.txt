Ferrell's college friend Craig Pollard started Cancer for College after twice battling cancer himself.
'Cancer for College' provides scholarships to current and former cancer patients whose medical bills left little for college.
Ferrell played doubles with tennis stars Novak Djokovic and Stand Wawrinka, as well as actor Kevin Spacey, to raise money for the cause.
