NEW: Greyhound: "We are investigating how they got there - in bags or from the bus".
Passengers on board a Greyhound bus to New York City say it was crawling with roaches.
"People were in the aisles literally brushing roaches off of them," says one.
Greyhound says passengers were moved to another bus and given refunds.
