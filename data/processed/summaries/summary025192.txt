A Hudson, New York, inn had a policy on its website imposing a fine for bad online reviews.
Internet users responded with a vengeance, posting negative comments and reviews on Yelp.
Language about the $500 penalty for bad reviews was removed from the inn's site.
Fine was "tongue-in-cheek," according to a Facebook post that was later removed.
