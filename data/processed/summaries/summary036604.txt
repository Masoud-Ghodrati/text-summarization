Padres pitcher Alex Torres is the first MLB player to wear a new protective cap in a game.
MLB approved the new caps, produced by 4Licensing Corporation, in January.
4Licensing says caps protect against line drives up to 85 mph on the side and 90 mph in front.
An MLB-commissioned study says average line drive to pitching mound travels 83 mph.
