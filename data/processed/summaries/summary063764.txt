Laura Moye: Supreme Court in 2002 barred death penalty for the "mentally retarded".
Moye: Yet court stood aside as Texas executed man who has the mind of a 7-year-old.
States can set criteria for "mental retardation," and court doesn't call them on it, she says.
Moye: Texas set stereotypical standards, citing character from Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men".
