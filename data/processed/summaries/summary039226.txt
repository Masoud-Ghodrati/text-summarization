"Camp Gyno" ad starring Macy McGrail has been seen nearly 10 million times.
In new video, McGrail's character makes some bad decisions during middle school.
The video is a trailer for McGrail's father's new book "Surviving Middle School".
Dave McGrail hopes his video and book spark a conversation just as "Camp Gyno" did.
