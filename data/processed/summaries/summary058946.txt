British boxer Nicola Adams is the first ever Olmypic gold medalist in women's boxing.
She fell in love with the sport as a child after watching her dad's video collection of boxing greats.
However, her career nearly came to an end after a serious back injury outside the ring.
She explains how she recovered just in time to make the selection for the British Olympic team this year.
