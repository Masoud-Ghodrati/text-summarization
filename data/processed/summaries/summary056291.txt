Mubarak was convicted in 2012 for the deaths of protesters, but was given a new trial.
The former president ruled Egypt for almost 30 years before resigning amid protests.
On Saturday, former president cleared of causing deaths of protesters.
Mubarak supporters and protesters on both sides say: the revolution is dead.
