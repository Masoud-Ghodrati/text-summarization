The deaths are the single largest loss of life among U.S. troops in Iraq since 2009.
Iraqi security officials say a mortar attack at a U.S. base in Baghdad killed the five.
The deaths follow warnings by the military of increased attacks on U.S. troops.
The U.S. military did not immediately say how the troops were killed.
