Brian Fugere was an active 47 year old before being diagnosed with cancer.
While hospitalized he was inspired by a book so he walked the hallways.
Later that year he did 144 laps around the hospital -- 26.2 miles -- to raise funds for charity.
Fugere continues to run and raise money for sarcoma research.
