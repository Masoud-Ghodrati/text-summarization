Internet tycoon Kim Dotcom launched a new file-storage and sharing site, Mega, on Sunday.
Authorities shut down Dotcom's previous venture, Megaupload.com, amid piracy allegations.
Mega offers all-encrypted storage for files that can't be opened by anyone -- even the host.
Dotcom: "This startup is probably the most scrutinized by lawyers in the history of tech startups".
