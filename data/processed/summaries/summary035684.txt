Hindu ritual of immersing idols in oceans, rivers and lakes is causing contamination.
Paints on idols often contain toxic metals, such as lead and mercury.
Pollutants contaminate plants, poison fish and irrigation and drinking water.
"Dry immersion" suggested as a solution -- idol is sprinkled symbolically with water.
