Dreaming of Africa is one way Prince William escapes from stresses he faces as future King of Britain.
In Africa, "I can let ... that sort of slightly immature, silly person come out a bit more," he says.
He says his mother, Diana, is never far from his thoughts. "It's about helping the needy and vulnerable".
Personal connection with Africa was sealed when he got engaged to Kate Middleton in Kenya in 2010.
