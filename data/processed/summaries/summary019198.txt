Gulet Mohamed, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is on a "no-fly" list and cannot fly home.
He says he was departing Kuwait after a visit when he was held and questioned.
His interrogators knew details about his family in the United States, he says.
Mohamed filed suit, claiming the U.S. is refusing to let him return home.
