David Eckert sued, saying police subjected him to "digital penetrations," enemas.
These actions and a colonoscopy occurred over 12 hours in early 2013 in New Mexico.
Authorities never found drugs; his lawsuit says the warrant used for search was invalid.
Eckert says the settlement gives him "some justice" and "shows they were wrong".
