CNN's Frederik Pleitgen takes the iconic German Trabant car for a spin.
The cars rolled across the border between what was then East and West Germany in 1989.
CNN hired the artist Martin Raumberger to give the car a makeover.
Thousands of people crowded around the car to sign it, draw on it, and take their picture with it.
