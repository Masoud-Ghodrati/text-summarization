Customs officials detected radiation from a couple's bag at a terminal Wednesday morning.
Passengers in the terminal were evacuated, and others were told to stay on a cruise ship.
The source of the radiation was found to be an old compass.
After the compass was found to be safe, it was returned to its owner.
