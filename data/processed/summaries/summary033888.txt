Chavez's socialist agenda has overseen nationalization in numerous industries.
His legacy is one of "Latin American Robin Hood" and "shrewd autocrat".
He announced his re-election bid after declaring himself cancer-free in July.
Chavez, at 44, was Venezuela's youngest person to be elected president in 1998.
