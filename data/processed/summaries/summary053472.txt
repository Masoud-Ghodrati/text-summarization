Elytte Barbour talks exclusively to CNN from a Pennsylvania prison.
He and his wife, Miranda, are accused of killing a man they met via Craigslist.
Miranda has since told a reporter she killed at least 22 people since turning 13.
Asked about details of what his wife told him, Elytte Barbour says "it was about 50/50".
