Once a propagandist, defector Song Byeok now paints satirical works about North Korea.
His paintings dwell on miseries of life in his homeland, joy of the freedoms he found in the South.
From a country of 25 million, only about 20,000 North Korean defectors live in the South.
Song is optimistic new leader Kim Jong Un will be an agent for change.
