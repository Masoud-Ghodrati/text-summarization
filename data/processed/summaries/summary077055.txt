Attackers shot dead an elderly Christian couple Sunday in their home, an Iraqi official says.
The attack was the latest in recent months targeting Christians in Iraq.
The official says 5 of 15 responsible for 3 major attacks remain at large.
Iraq's prime minister assures an Italian minister the attackers will be "severely punished".
