Ten Americans held in Haiti, accused of illegally trying to take 33 children out of the country.
They were detained Friday as they tried to take children across border into Dominican Republic.
The missionaries say they were just trying to help the children start a new life.
But Haiti's prime minister said Sunday the group was kidnapping the children.
