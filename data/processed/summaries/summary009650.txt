U.S. Army Sgt. Robert Sanabria hadn't seen his brother, Edwin, since 1999.
Edwin, who suffered from mental disabilities, left home at 18 to live with his girlfriend.
Robert recently learned his brother and the girlfriend were held captive.
They have reunited and Robert hopes to care for his brother from now on.
