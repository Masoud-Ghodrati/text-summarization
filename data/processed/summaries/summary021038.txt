Nearly half in New Jersey think it's "kind of cool" that Christie loves Springsteen.
That's according to a new poll in honor of Springsteen's 65th birthday.
Christie has been to 132 Springsteen concerts and holds out hope the two will be friends.
Springsteen, a liberal, has never expressed the same kind of love toward Christie.
