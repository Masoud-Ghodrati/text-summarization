Panera Bread CEO Ron Shaich lived on the amount a food stamp recipient gets each day.
Shaich thought he knew about hunger, but this opened his eyes to real problem.
He drank water and ate carbs, lost energy and admits it was only a week, not his life.
Shaich says hunger is not "their" problem, it's ours as a society.
