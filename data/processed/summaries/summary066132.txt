Report: Jeezy was arrested after cursing at officers and refusing to identify himself.
He was reportedly seen leaving the back of a home after a security alarm went off.
Earlier this month, he turned himself in after allegations he threatened to kill his son.
The teen son also said Jeezy slammed his head against a shower door and choked him.
