Airline pilot Steve Danyluk was flying over Atlantic during bomb attempt but wasn't notified.
He only learned about it after landing "when I looked at the CNN Web site on my iPhone".
Writes "government clearly dropped the ball" after the incident as well as before.
Danyluk: Only luck that this was not a coordinated attack involving multiple aircraft.
