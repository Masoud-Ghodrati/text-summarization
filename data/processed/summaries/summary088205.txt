"It's the largest single-species event" in the Northeast, a marine mammal expert says.
Only 37 of 129 dolphins have survived to be released, says IFAW's Katie Moore.
Necropsies have been done on nine animals; no cause has been determined.
Some of the released animals have been tracked north of Cape Cod, where they belong.
