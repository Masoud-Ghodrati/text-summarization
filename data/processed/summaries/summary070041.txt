Honduran city has been dubbed "the murder capital of the world".
Fueled by the drug trade, rival gangs duel in San Pedro Sula for recruits, territory and cash.
From January to June of this year, the city had 538 homicides.
Even the city's director of forensic medicine was given two full-time bodyguards.
