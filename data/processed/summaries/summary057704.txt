Windsurfing is a family affair for Cyril Moussilmani and his younger twin brothers.
Cyril first wanted to try windsurfing as a nine-year-old in his hometown of Marseille.
He trains about 10-15 hours in the gym, aside from practicing his skills on the water.
Frenchman enjoys traveling the world, although lugging around his equipment is tough.
