Australia's highest court rejected extradition request from Hungary for suspected Nazi war criminal.
Charles Zentai allegedly beat Jewish teen to death in 1944 for failing to wear Star of David.
High Court ruled against request because "war crime" was not legal offence in Hungary in 1944.
A naturalized Australian citizen, Zentai has maintained his innocence.
