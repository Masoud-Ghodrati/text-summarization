Icelandic authorities say there's increased seismic activity around Bardarbunga volcano.
But there's no sign yet of magma moving to the surface or ash spewing into the sky.
Iceland has posted an orange aviation alert, indicating "increased potential of eruption".
The eruption of Eyjafjallajokull in 2010 caused disruption to millions of travelers.
