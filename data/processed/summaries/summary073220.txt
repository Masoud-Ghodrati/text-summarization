Leanne Hecht Bearden had recently returned to the U.S. after a 22-month global trek.
She was last seen January 17, leaving her in-laws' house in Texas for a walk.
Investigators believe she died shortly after leaving for that walk, police chief says.
A preliminary autopsy finds she died by "asphyxiation by hanging".
