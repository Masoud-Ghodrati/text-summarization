A Lockerbie victim's mother says she has "no pity" for a "mass murderer".
Al Megrahi was convicted of murder after 270 died when Pan Am 103 blew up over Scotland.
He was released in August 2009 on "compassionate grounds" and welcomed warmly in Libya.
A Scottish official defends the release, which Britain's current leader and others still criticize.
