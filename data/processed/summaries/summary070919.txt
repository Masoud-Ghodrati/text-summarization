Zahi Hawass gets year in jail, loses job for refusing to carry out a court order, CNN is told.
The antiquities minister says an appeals court has decreed he will keep his job, not serve time.
Charges stem from a lawsuit brought by the then-tenant of a Cairo Museum bookstore.
The order came after the process he was to stop was already over, Hawass says.
