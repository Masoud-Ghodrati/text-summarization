Former player Eric Naposki and Nanette Packard McNeal could face life sentences.
DA says Packard McNeal persuaded Naposki to kill her wealthy boyfriend.
Motive was money, authorities say: $1 million insurance policy and $150,000 in will.
She's due in court Friday; Naposki may be sent to California from Connecticut.
