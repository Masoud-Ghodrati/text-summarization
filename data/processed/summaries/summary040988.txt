Baldwin's paparazzi clash happened outside New York's Marriage License Bureau.
"A 'photographer' almost hit me in the face with his camera this morning," Baldwin tweets.
"He was looking mad," the photographer tells the New York Daily News.
"Any subsequent physical contact was simply Alec protecting himself," rep says.
