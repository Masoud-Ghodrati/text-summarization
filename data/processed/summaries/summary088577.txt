Two years ago, Diane and Sam McMutrie decided to adopt 4-year-old Fredo from Haiti.
The adoption process was sped up after the January quake devastated his orphanage in Port-au-Prince.
The McMutries' grown daughters played a key role in getting Fredo into their lives.
They plan to allow Fredo to keep in touch with his family in Haiti.
