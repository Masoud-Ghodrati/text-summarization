Jiamei Tian was arrested Monday after paint vandalism at Washington's National Cathedral.
A judge rules that she will go to a halfway house until her next hearing in four weeks.
Prosecutors had argued that Tian, who traveled on a Chinese passport, was a flight risk.
A detective says tread marks at another vandalism site match Tian's shoe.
