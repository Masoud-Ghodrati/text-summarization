On August 6, 2011, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Afghanistan, killing 30.
Among them was 10-year-old Braydon Nichols' father. Nichols wrote an iReport about his dad.
Since then, readers haven't stopped commenting on Braydon's iReport.
The story made one Army veteran and father recall his close brush with death.
