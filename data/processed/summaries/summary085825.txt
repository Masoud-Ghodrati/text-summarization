Ruchira Gupta says the rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai is not surprising.
Gupta: Women don't report rapes because they will be stigmatized and traumatized.
When Gupta appeared in court to report an attack, lawyers held her responsible.
Gupta: Culture of rape is ingrained in misogynistic society where men in control don't care.
