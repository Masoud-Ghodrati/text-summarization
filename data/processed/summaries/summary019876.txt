David Frum: George H.W. Bush, 88, must recover to continue to inspire on way to 90.
Bush has packed much into life: war hero, ambassador, CIA chief, VP, president.
He says elder Bush not given enough credit for role in shepherding end of Cold War.
Frum: Bush will not toot own horn; others (Kuwaitis, Eastern Europeans, Americans) should.
