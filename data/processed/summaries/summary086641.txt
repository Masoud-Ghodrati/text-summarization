Dreonna Breton is a pregnant nurse who was working in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
She says she was fired from her job when she rejected taking a flu vaccine.
It's unconscionable for a health care worker not to be immunized, employer says.
Breton, who says she's had three miscarriages, fears vaccine could trigger another.
