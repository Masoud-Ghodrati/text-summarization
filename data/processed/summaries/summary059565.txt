Howard Kurtz: 'Maya' in new film on finding bin Laden is based on real, but anonymous, operative.
He says questions are mounting about the CIA employee but she can't speak to the press.
"Zero Dark Thirty" producers had unusual access to real story of bin Laden operation, he says.
Kurtz: Giving filmmakers such access raises questions about way they portrayed the story.
