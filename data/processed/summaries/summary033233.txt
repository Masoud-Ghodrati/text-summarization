Science is now looking to nature to find the best way to store data in a way that will make it last for millennia.
Just one gram of DNA is theoretically capable of containing all the data of internet giants such as Google and Facebook.
Researchers in Zurich wanted to find ways to combine the storage capacity of DNA with the stability of the DNA found in fossils.
The Zurich team say their process could make the data encoded in DNA readable in 10,000 years' time or even longer.
