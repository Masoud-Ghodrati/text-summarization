William Bennett says three men in Colorado shooting died while shielding girlfriends.
He says actions of Jon Blunk, Alex Teves, Matt McQuinn leave us wondering at their sacrifice.
Bennett: It was more than chivalry; it was a code of honor, an instinct to protect, not run.
Bennett: The three had their struggles, showed themselves as good men, real-life heroes.
