Todd Graham: Campaigns are spinning but know that Romney, Obama are good debaters.
On Romney's strengths: He's smooth, knowledgeable, good at pivoting from questions.
On Obama's strengths: Stays cool, strong presence, good focus and reasoning.
Graham: Both have weaknesses that are flip sides of strengths; expect a good debate.
