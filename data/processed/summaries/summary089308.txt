NEW: DeSalvos "outraged, disgusted " by secret DNA collection, their attorney says.
NEW: "We have offered them DNA as recently as last year," the attorney says.
DNA from a relative links Albert DeSalvo to the last Strangler victim, Mary Sullivan.
DeSalvo was never charged in the killings and was stabbed to death in 1973.
