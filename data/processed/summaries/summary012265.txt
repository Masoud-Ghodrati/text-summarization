Dean Obeidallah says "despise" is not strong enough to convey how much he hates terrorism.
He says Islam is being wrongly defined by a tiny group of morally bankrupt terrorists.
American Muslims have denounced terror over and over, he says, but public hasn't heard.
Terrorists are motivated by politics, he says. Not one Muslim he knows supports terror.
