NEW: A neighbor says, "I would have never dreamed this in a million years".
The suspect, who doesn't have a lawyer, will be in court Tuesday, an official says.
Shawn Morgan is charged with first-degree murder in a 3-year-old girl's death.
An affidavit states he told police he grabbed the girl and suffocated her.
