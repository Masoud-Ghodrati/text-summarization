"Sit down, Hind!" has become a popular Twitter hashtag.
Hind al-Fayez, a member of Jordan's Parliament, was told by a fellow member to sit down.
The male parliamentarian then verbally blasts women being in the country's legislature.
"The lady made a point. She should never obey and sit down," says one tweet.
