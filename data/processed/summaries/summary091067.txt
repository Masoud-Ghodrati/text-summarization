Raqqa, one of Syria's most liberal cities, has been seized by al Qaeda-backed militants.
Fear has gripped the town as militants have imposed hardline Islamic laws in recent months.
Women's rights have been curtailed and many activists and locals have fled the town.
Activist: "It's like Afghanistan. Now people call Raqqa Tora Bora.".
