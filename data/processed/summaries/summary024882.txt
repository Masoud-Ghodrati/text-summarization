LeWeb founder Loic Le Meur is looking to "digital hippies" as a potential theme for his next conference.
Le Meur is seeing a trend of entrepreneurs who reject money, fame and power.
Digital hippies are not the only trend on his radar. The return of hardware is another.
Le Meur is a Davos veteran and says the forum is valuable for building relationships.
