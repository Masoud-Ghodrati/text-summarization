The attack bears the hallmarks of al Qaeda, an Interior Ministry source says.
Tuesday's attack came as anti-government protests in Yemen continue to attract huge crowds.
Another such attempt was made in August, senior security officials in Abyan province said then.
The defense minister's office had denied the August report.
