Jacqueline Woodson won the National Book Award for the memoir "Brown Girl Dreaming".
After she accepted the award, "Lemony Snicket" author Daniel Handler shared a story.
Handler said he told Woodson to write about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon.
Handler later apologized for the joke, which many denounced as "racist" and inappropriate.
