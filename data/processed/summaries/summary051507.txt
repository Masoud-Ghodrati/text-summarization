Federal police say Edgar Valdez Villarreal has tried to blackmail authorities.
The accused drug lord says in a letter that he paid off security officials.
His letter, police say, is an attempt to stop authorities and skirt justice.
Valdez is known as "La Barbie" because of his blue eyes and light complexion.
