A landmark statue has disappeared from a roundabout in Libya's capital, Tripoli.
The bronze statue of a naked woman stroking a gazelle dated from the Italian colonial era.
Islamist militants had previously branded the statue immoral and threatened to remove it.
The Cultural Ministry said the "vandalism" was an attempt to obliterate Libya's history.
