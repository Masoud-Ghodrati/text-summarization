Apple's new smartwatch was designed to be a fashion accessory as well as a gadget.
It comes in two sizes, different finishes and has multiple slick strap options.
Apple is going up against huge watch companies and an industry that has been around for a century.
The device could be the next iPod or it could go the way of the Bluetooth headset.
