Scientists are trying to land a probe on Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
The European Space Agency says it now has chosen a prime target landing site.
The comet is so far from Earth the Philae lander needs to be programed to land on its own.
It took more than 10 years to position the Rosetta craft so it could follow the comet.
