NEW: Sudan says it will not cooperate with International Criminal Court.
ICC charged Sudan president Omar Hassan al-Bashir with Darfur war crimes.
It is first the first arrest warrant ever issued for a sitting head of state.
About 300,000 have died in Darfur, U.N. says; 2.5 million forced from homes.
