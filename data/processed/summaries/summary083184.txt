NEW: Suspect's family shocked by allegations, his mother says.
Jose Pimentel is accused of plotting to attack U.S. veterans, police and post offices.
Pimentel said he was one hour away from finishing his first bomb, police say.
"He was not part of a larger conspiracy," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says.
