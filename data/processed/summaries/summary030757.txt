Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood hoping to take Tiger Woods' No. 1 ranking.
Woods has been at the summit for 270 consecutive weeks, and 612 overall.
No. 2 Mickelson can surpass Woods if he wins or finishes in top four and compatriot 38th.
Westwood needs to win and have Woods finish outside the top two at Firestone.
