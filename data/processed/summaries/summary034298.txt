A Pennsylvania judge has until Tuesday to rule on state's voter ID law.
The judge will determine whether or not the law disenfranchises voters.
The law requires all voters to bring state-issued photo ID to the polls each time they vote.
Supporters say the law prevents fraud; detractors say the law disenfranchises voters.
