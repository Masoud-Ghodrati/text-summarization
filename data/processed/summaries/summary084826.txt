Butch Davis was fired as head football coach at UNC as academic scandal unfolded.
Davis: "I can tell you with ever fiber in me that I did not know about cheating".
Davis said he doesn't get enough credit for raising his players' GPAs, graduation rates.
Critics say "paper classes" were part of the reason those GPAs rose.
