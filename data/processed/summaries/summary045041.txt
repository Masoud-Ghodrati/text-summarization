U.S. spends billions on an enormous intelligence bureaucracy, says Peter Bergen.
He says nearly a decade after 9/11, U.S. can't locate Osama bin Laden.
American intelligence agencies aren't positioned to infiltrate militant groups, he says.
Bergen: "Budgets should be cut if the CIA can't provide proof that it is penetrating al-Qaeda".
