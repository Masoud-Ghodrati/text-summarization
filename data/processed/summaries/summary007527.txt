Brian David Mitchell is charged with kidnapping Elizabeth Smart from her bedroom in 2002.
Smart, then 14, was found nine months later walking with Mitchell and his wife.
Mitchell's attorneys apparently plan to ask for change of venue.
Under a plea deal, Mitchell's wife agreed to cooperate in case against her husband.
