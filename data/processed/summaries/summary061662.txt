Former U.S. national soccer coach Bob Bradley accepts offer from Egyptian FA.
Its president Sameer Zahir says the 53-year-old is due in Cairo to sign contract.
Bradley was sacked by U.S. Soccer in June after five years in the role.
He guided the U.S. to the last 16 of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
