Death sentences in the United States are below 100 for the first time since 1976.
Only 43 people have been put to death in 2011, down 56% from 12 years ago.
A poll conducted in October found 50% of Americans favor a sentence of life in prison.
California voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty.
