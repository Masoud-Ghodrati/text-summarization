A "cardboard cathedral" has been given the go-ahead for construction in Christchurch, New Zealand.
The temporary A-framed structure will be finished by the end of 2012.
The old Anglican cathedral was badly damaged by the 2011 earthquake which struck the city.
Bishop of Christchurch, Victoria Mathews announced in March that the cathedral would be condemned.
