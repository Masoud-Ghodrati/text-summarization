Museveni signs bill that could mean life in prison for "aggravated homosexuality".
The bill, which has been debated in Uganda for years, originally included a death penalty.
President Barack Obama said enacting the bill would affect U.S. relations with Uganda.
Museveni rejects criticism of the bill as an imperialistic push by West to impose values on others.
