United Flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo was diverted to Seattle on Tuesday.
The unscheduled landing was "due to an indication of a problem with an oil filter".
787s returned to service this year after battery troubles grounded them for four months.
The unscheduled landing comes the same day United ordered 20 new Dreamliners.
