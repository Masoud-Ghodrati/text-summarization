Alex Rodriguez paid his cousin $900,000 in return for his silence, prosecutors say.
The cousin's lawyer says money was a settlement for a breached employment agreement.
Court papers link the cousin to a clinic at the center of baseball's doping scandal.
The cousin introduced Rodriguez to the founder of the clinic, the documents say.
