Testing confirms some of the blood belongs to missing Ayla Reynolds.
Police say some of that blood "was visible to the naked eye, some wasn't".
Three adults were in Ayla's home the night before she was reported missing.
Their accounts don't "pass the 'straight-face' test," a Maine state spokesman says.
