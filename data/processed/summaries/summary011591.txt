NEW: Apollo Nida posted a video just before walking into prison early Thursday.
There was "an incident" with Nida at his Atlanta home, his wife's publicist says.
Nida was ordered to report to a federal prison in Kentucky on Wednesday.
His fraud scheme stole millions from at least 50 people over four years, a prosecutor says.
