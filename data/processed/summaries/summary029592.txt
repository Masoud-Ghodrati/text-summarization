There are just two candidates in Egypt's presidential election, with polling due on May 26, 27.
Ex-general Abdel Fattah el-Sisi faces left-leaning politician Hamdeen Sabahi.
The election follows last year's ouster of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsy.
CNN's Reza Sayah says both candidates have generally remained vague on policy details.
