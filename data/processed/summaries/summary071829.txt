Paul Waldman: Obama announced gun curbs; gun advocates said it'll be tyranny.
NRA ad calling Obama "elitist" because his kids get protection is not sane view, he says.
He says some gun advocates urge resistance to duly authorized law enforcement.
Waldman: Freedom is guaranteed by law, not gun owners.
