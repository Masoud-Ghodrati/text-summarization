Tensions are high following the slaying of a British soldier in London on Wednesday.
Police say 1,500-2,000 people joined a far-right EDL march in Newcastle.
"We cannot allow this soldier's death to be in vain," the group's leader says.
Imams sign a letter condemning the murder in Woolwich as a senseless act of depravity.
