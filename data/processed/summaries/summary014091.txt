Hasan is accused of killing 13, wounding 32 in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting.
Hasan had communicated via e-mail with Islamic cleric Anwar al-Awlaki before shooting.
Officials learned Hasan was e-mailing al-Awlaki starting in December of 2008.
"An interview would have been prudent," an FBI official tells a congressional hearing.
