Underwater hockey is popular in Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.
It's gaining popularity in the U.S., but can't be "picked up on the corner lot" like other sports.
Players try to push a 3-pound puck at the bottom of a pool into goals.
"This is for people who are true athletes," one player says.
