NEW: The raids targeted people supporting radical ideology online, the interior minister says.
Raids took place in Toulouse, Marseille, Nantes and Lyon and around Paris, officials say.
The operation targets those connected with "a form of radical Islam," Sarkozy says.
The trauma of the Toulouse attacks for France was a bit like 9/11 for the U.S., Sarkozy says.
