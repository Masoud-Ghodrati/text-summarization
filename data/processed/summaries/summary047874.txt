Singer Jennifer Lopez draws criticism for her performance in Turkmenistan.
John Sutter says the "Happy Birthday" concert actually was productive.
He says Lopez inadvertently lent her celebrity to raising awareness about human rights.
Sutter: "a diva's visit with a despot can raise more than awareness".
