Rene Lacoste has left a lasting legacy in tennis and fashion.
He helped France to its maiden Davis Cup win in 1927 and was a top singles player.
After retirement he created the "Lacoste" brand, introducing polo shirts and new rackets.
France will play in the semifinals of the Davis Cup team competition this weekend.
