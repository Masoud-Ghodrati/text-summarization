Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, has introduced a VIP paid membership package.
Weibo's VIP membership includes fifteen special features for a monthly price of 10 RMB (US$ 1.57).
The move is intended to monetize Weibo, as Sina Corporation posted a Q1 2012 loss of US$ 13.7 million.
