NEW: August Busch IV is the only member of his family on Anheuser-Busch InBev's board.
The body of Adrienne Nicole Martin, 27, is found in a Missouri home, police say.
The Frontenac home belongs to Busch, a former CEO of Anheuser-Busch.
Busch's lawyer says there's nothing suspicious in the "tragic death ... of a nice young lady".
