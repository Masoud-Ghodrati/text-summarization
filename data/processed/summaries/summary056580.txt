"Jackie Lomax is a singer of energy and passion," his 1969 album notes said.
Lomax played in early 1960s rock groups, crossing the path of the Beatles in pubs.
The Beatles' Apple Records signed Lomax as a songwriter and artist.
He never produced hits despite having three Beatles recording with him.
