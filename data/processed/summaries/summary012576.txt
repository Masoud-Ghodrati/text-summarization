Kirk Bloodsworth: I was first in U.S. sentenced to death row to be exonerated by DNA evidence.
Witnesses, not physical evidence, tied him to rape, murder.
Life in prison hell on earth. He found book on DNA testing, lawyer pursued, he was freed.
Bloodsworth: End capital punishment. I am proof that system is broken beyond repair.
