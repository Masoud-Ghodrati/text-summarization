A witness sees a woman push a stroller from a subway car after its doors open.
She leaves the stroller and baby on the platform, and she continues riding the train.
Police say the baby girl is in stable condition and not malnourished.
New York police have detained a 20-year-old woman, say she's the baby's mother.
