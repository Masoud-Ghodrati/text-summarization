NEW: Collins' estranged wife: I had nothing to do with the release of a recording to the media.
Collins, 67, starred in "7th Heaven" as the patriarch of the central family.
In court papers, an estranged wife claims Collins told her he had molested three girls.
Collins' legal response says the claims are attempted extortion in a divorce.
