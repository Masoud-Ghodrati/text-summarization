Africa's top writers have joined forces for short story anthology.
It will go live on Valentine's Day in digital and audio formats in a variety of languages.
Nigerian publishers hope the stories will be seen as a "sensuous antidote to election fatigue".
The anthology intends to combat negative perceptions of everyday life in Africa.
