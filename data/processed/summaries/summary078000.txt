Olympic sprint gold medalist Sherone Simpson is to appeal her doping suspension.
Simpson's agent Paul Doyle calls the 18-month ban "incredibly unjust".
Simpson tested positive for banned stimulant oxilofrine at last year's Jamaican trials.
A ruling in the case of fellow Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell is expected on Thursday.
