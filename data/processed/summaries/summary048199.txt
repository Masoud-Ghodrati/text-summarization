Veteran German goalkeeper has won World Cup twice, once as reserve, once as a player.
Angerer shot to fame at 2007 World Cup breaking world record time for not conceding a goal.
She went 540 minutes without letting in a goal and saved a penalty in the final.
In January 2013, the 36-year-old became first goalkeeper to win the FIFA Ballon d'Or.
