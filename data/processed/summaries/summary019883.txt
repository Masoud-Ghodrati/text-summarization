Moerenuma Park on the outskirts of Sapporo was the final act of Japanese-American sculptor Isuma Noguchi.
Fusing art, nature and industrial design, Noguchi's park took 17 years to complete.
He volunteered to live in an internment camp during WWII to design better equipment for the people in the camp.
