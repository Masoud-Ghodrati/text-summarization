As a child, CNN's Fred Pleitgen lived in East Berlin under the watchful eye of the Stasi.
His father Fritz, a journalist at a West German TV network, says the Stasi broke into the family flat.
Fritz: Stasi's nightmare was "an alliance of Western journalists with the East German people".
Fred Pleitgen: It's amazing how far German capital has come since the Berlin Wall came down.
