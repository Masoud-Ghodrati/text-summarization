Gov. Cuomo is set to act on medical marijuana, advocates briefed on his plan say.
He'll take executive action to set up a system where hospitals can distribute pot.
Advocates are excited about the plan, but say comprehensive legislation still needed.
20 states -- including New Jersey, Vermont, Connecticut -- allow medical marijuana.
