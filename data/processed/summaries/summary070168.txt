NEW: Semenya takes second place in the 800-meter qualifying heats.
She was the subject of a gender test following her 2009 victory in Berlin.
Her masculine build, chiseled abs and deep voice fueled rumors about her gender.
She has since been cleared to compete and says "running is everything" to her.
