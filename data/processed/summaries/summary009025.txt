Matthew Brouillette: Detroit's pension mess is a warning to other cities and states.
Brouillette: Solution is to switch to 401(k) plans which is common in the private sector.
He says market risks of 401(k)s require more personal responsibility for workers.
Brouillette: If cities and states keep the pension system, it will be too costly in the long run.
