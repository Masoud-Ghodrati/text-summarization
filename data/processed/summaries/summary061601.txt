Nicolaus Mills remembers MLK's march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights.
King was fighting for voting rights, he says, 48 years later, voting issues are re-emerging.
Mills: Today's voter suppression is subtle compared with the past's crude, racist attempts.
Mills: As we honor MLK, we should fight voter ID laws and attempts to erode voting rights.
