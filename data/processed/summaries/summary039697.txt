About 30 people drive for Virginia Hospital Center during inclement weather.
Hospital transport coordinator: Volunteer drivers are "unbelievable saviors for us".
One volunteer, Scott Long, got up at 6 a.m. to begin shuttling hospital workers.
Long: "I get to play in the snow and nobody can yell at me for being out driving in the snow".
