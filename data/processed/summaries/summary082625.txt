Andy Coulson left News of The World after its then-royal editor was jailed for phone hacking.
Coulson said he knew nothing about the hacking but resigned because he had been editor.
Then-opposition leader David Cameron later hired Coulson as his director of communications.
Coulson went on trial in October 2013. He was found guilty of conspiracy to hack phones.
