Greenbird, driven by Richard Jenkins, claims the land sailing speed record.
The land yacht reaches 202 km/hour (126.1 miles/hour) on a dry lake in California.
Makers describe craft as "part airplane, part sailboat and part Formula One car".
Jenkins is now aiming to better the speed in Montana in his ice-sailing craft.
