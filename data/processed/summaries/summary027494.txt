NEW: Official: Abu Khatallah denied involvement but gave info on others.
Abu Khatallah gave information before and after he was told his Miranda rights.
Sen. Lindsey Graham: Mirandizing Abu Khatallah "would be a mistake for the ages".
He is suspected of being the ringleader of the September 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.
