Carter, who grew up in the Bronx, set up Sustainable South Bronx in 2001.
She wrote a $1.25M Federal Transportation planning grant for the South Bronx.
The 11-mile-long stretch is the first South Bronx waterfront park in 60 years.
Carter wants to see the South Bronx become a thriving community again.
