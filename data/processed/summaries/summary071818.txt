The girl's parents and 2 siblings died in the storm, a hospital official says.
She remained in critical condition Saturday evening, he adds.
The 20-month-old girl was found alone, without ID, in an Indiana field, authorities say.
Authorities are also searching for a 9-year-old boy missing since the tornadoes hit.
