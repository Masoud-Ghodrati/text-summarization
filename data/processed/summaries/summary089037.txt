British Ministry of Defense releases files on UFO sightings dating back to 1970s.
The documents include witness accounts and the government's response.
Ministry says ufology is "claptrap" and no evidence at all of alien space craft.
It held onto records to determine if enemy aircraft had infiltrated UK airspace.
