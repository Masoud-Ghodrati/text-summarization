Emanuel Rego and Alison Cerutti are one of Brazil's top beach volleyball teams.
Nicknamed "Bones and Mammoth," they won silver at London 2012 Olympics.
The 40-year-old Rego has played at all five of the sport's Olympic appearances.
He wants to add to his full collection of medals on home soil at Rio in 2016.
