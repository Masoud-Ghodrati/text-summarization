Bobby Jindal: President Obama failed to deliver what he promised on the economy.
He says the president is signalling that his campaign will be one of "divide and blame".
Obama makes excuses for failing on economy, promotes class warfare, Jindal says.
Jindal: Choice is between trying to rebuild economy through government or the private sector.
