NEW: Investigator: Schumacher was traveling at "a normal speed for an experienced skier".
Prosecutor says "speed is not a particularly important element" in inquiry into accident.
Schumacher's skis were not faulty, lead prosecutor Patrick Quincy says.
Investigators are studying footage from the racing driver's helmet camera for more clues.
