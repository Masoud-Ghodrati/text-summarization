The trouble began when Zadora said she was tired and ordered her son to bed, police say.
She became "upset and angry" and "started squirting everyone" with a water hose, son says.
Zadora scratched her son's ear as they wrestled over his cell phone, police say.
Zadora's fame is partly based on a Hollywood awards scandal in 1982.
