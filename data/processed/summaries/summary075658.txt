A story about Shiite cleric Mahmud al-Sarkhi angered supporters.
It claimed al-Sarkhi plans to wrest control of the religious authority in Karbala.
U.N. mission in Iraq calls attacks "unacceptable under any circumstances".
A spokesman for al-Sarkhi says his office had nothing to do with the assaults.
