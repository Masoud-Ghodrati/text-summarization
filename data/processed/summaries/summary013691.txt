Ruben Navarrette: GOP "rock star" Marco Rubio has warring details in his life story.
He says there are conflicts in when Rubio says parents left Cuba and when they actually did.
He says Latino friends doubt Rubio's explanation: Cuban emigres know when they left.
Navarrette: Only reason it's an issue is because Rubio is real threat to Democats.
