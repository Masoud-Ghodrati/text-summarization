Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, is hanged at a jail southeast of Mumbai.
His petition for clemency was rejected by the Indian president.
He was convicted for his role in the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, which killed more than 160 people.
It is the first use of capital punishment in India in eight years.
