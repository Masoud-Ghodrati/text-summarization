The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George are visiting NZ and Australia.
Prince William and Catherine visited the small town of Cambridge Saturday.
By lunchtime, the town's population had doubled as people gathered to see them.
There were scenes of screaming and one well-wisher described going "all gooey".
