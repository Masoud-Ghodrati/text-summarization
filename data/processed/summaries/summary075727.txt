"Brave Miss World" received an Emmy nomination.
The documentary follows 1998 Miss World Linor Abargil's journey from survivor to activist.
Abargil was raped by someone she knew weeks before winning the 1998 Miss World crown.
"It was important for Linor to inject real meaning to the crown," producer says.
