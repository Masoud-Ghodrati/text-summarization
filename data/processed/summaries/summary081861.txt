A judge has filed preliminary charges of financial corruption against Spain's Princess Cristina.
Earlier charges were dropped after prosecutors appealed, citing insufficient evidence.
The princess's husband faces preliminary charges of diverting public funds for private use.
Inaki Urdangarin married Cristina, King Juan Carlos' youngest daughter, in 1997.
