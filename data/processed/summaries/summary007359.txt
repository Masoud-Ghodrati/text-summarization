Appeals court: Casey Anthony can't "take advantage" of an administrative error.
The ruling comes a day after a motion from Florida's attorney general.
Anthony's lawyers argued she shouldn't serve probation on check fraud charges.
A document states she'd serve that probation in prison, despite what a judge said.
