Designer Michael Graves says Steve Jobs added innovation to the designer's tool kit.
He says Jobs recognized clean, well-staffed stores were all that was needed to show products.
Jobs was aware illness would limit his time, wanted each day to make a contribution, he says.
Graves: Jobs wanted to leave this world exhausted from his passion for his life's work.
