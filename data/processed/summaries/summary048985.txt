Whether you've got a week or just a few hours, make the most of your Grand Canyon trip.
The South Rim, which may be the country's most diverse place, is good for a quick trip.
The North Rim attracts visitors inclined to stay a little longer.
The most compelling reason for a week in the canyon is to visit both rims.
