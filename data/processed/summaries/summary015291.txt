"Weisure" is the blurring of work and play -- both what we do and where we do it.
Weisure is changing modern society, says NYU sociologist Dalton Conley.
"We lose our private sphere," he says. "There's less time to be our backstage selves".
Why? Technology, longer workweek and more workers enjoying their jobs.
