The clash occurred at a house in the Dagestan village of Karlanyurt, RIA Novosti reports.
It says at least 5 officers were injured in the clash, which came amid an anti-terror operation.
Russia has been trying to address security concerns before the Winter Olympics.
Security fears have been heightened after bombings in Volgograd last month.
