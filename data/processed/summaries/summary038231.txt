NEW: "The alleged victim has major credibility issues," Zickuhr's lawyer says.
Tim Zickuhr appeared as a driver in episodes of "Ice Road Truckers: Deadliest Roads".
Zickuhr was arrested by a police officer who knew the woman as a source.
He allegedly kidnapped a prostitute who works under the name "Snow White".
