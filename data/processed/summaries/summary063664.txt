Knox and Raffaele Sollecito resentenced in the Meredith Kercher murder case.
Kercher was found stabbed in 2007 in a villa she rented with Knox in Perugia, Italy.
Knox and Sollecito's 2009 murder convictions were overturned on appeal in 2011.
Legal expert tells CNN that it is unlikely the U.S. would allow Knox to be extradited to Italy.
