Two Chinese men are facing attempted murder charges in the shooting of mine workers.
The unarmed miners were protesting poor labor conditions.
The shooting is the latest in a string of attacks between Zambian workers and Chinese managers.
'Where did the Chinese get the right to shoot innocent Zambians,' victim's father asks.
