LInda Welton's family has been selling star maps along Sunset Boulevard since the 1930s.
The owners of the house where Michael Jackson died are taking her to court.
They say her star maps business is an eyesore and a public nuisance.
Welton's mother won a similar court battle with the City of Los Angeles in the 1970s.
