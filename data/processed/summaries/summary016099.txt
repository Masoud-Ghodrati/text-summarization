Radovan Karadzic is accused in the Srebrenica massacre, in which about 8,000 Muslims died.
His charges stem from the violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
Karadzic disguised himself and hid in plain sight for more 13 years before his capture.
He could face life in prison if convicted.
