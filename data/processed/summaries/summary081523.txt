Danny Cevallos: Michael Dunn's testimony highlights important legal points in his murder case.
Cevallos: Dunn is not George Zimmerman; his self-defense case is comparatively weak.
He says Dunn had to prove he had a reasonable fear of being seriously harmed.
Cevallos: Also, he had to explain why he fled, why he shot 10 rounds into the teens' car.
