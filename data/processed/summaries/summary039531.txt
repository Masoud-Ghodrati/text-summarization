A sheriff's captain says Jose Martinez admitted to killing an Alabama man.
He also said he killed more than 30 men total in his job as a drug trade enforcer.
Authorities say at least 13 deaths, 10 in California, have been linked to Martinez.
He's also suspected in a 2006 double homicide in Florida, authorities there say.
