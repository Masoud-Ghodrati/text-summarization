David Nathan disputes CNN op-ed by David Frum that argues pot should be illegal.
Nathan treats drug abusers and agrees with Frum that young people should avoid marijuana.
Drug should be legal for adults and sold like alcohol, with kids taught the risks, he says.
Nathan: If pot is illegal, then dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco should be, too.
