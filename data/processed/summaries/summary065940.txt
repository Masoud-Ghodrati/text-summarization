Rebecca Edmonds grew up as a military kid, joining the ROTC in high school.
Weeks before becoming an Air Force officer, she discovered she was pregnant.
The Air Force ejected her because it forbids single parents from enlisting.
Edmonds has appealed that decision, and her case is currently being reviewed.
