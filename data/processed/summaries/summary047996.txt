Belgian agent lodges a complaint with the European Commission over UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules.
Agent represented by lawyer who helped revolutionize the way transfer system works.
Complaint argues UEFA's "break-even rule" restricts competition.
In December, Malaga handed a season-long ban from UEFA club competitions after falling foul of FFP.
