Tijuana police officer's arraignment postponed until next week because of "snafu".
Border Patrol agents pulled Noe Raygoza-Garcia over last month in California.
Affidavit: He was "shaking excessively" and didn't know where his dying uncle lived.
Agents say they found 13 pounds of heroin and 6 pounds of methamphetamine in car.
