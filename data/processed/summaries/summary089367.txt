Kathleen Savio was found dead in her bathtub in 2004.
First called an accident, her death was later ruled "homicide staged to look like an accident".
Her ex-husband, Drew Peterson, was charged in 2009 and held on $20 million bond.
He is also the prime suspect in the 2007 disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson.
