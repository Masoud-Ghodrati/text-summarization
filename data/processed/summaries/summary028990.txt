Melissa Nelson worked as a dental assistant for James Knight for more than 10 years.
Knight complained Nelson wore tight clothes, was a "detriment" to his family.
Knight's wife demanded he fire Nelson; he did.
The all-male high court rules her termination did not constitute unlawful discrimination.
