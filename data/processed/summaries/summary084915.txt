NEW: A defense attorney says he feels jurors will decide "death is not the appropriate penalty".
Anthony Sowell was convicted of killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009.
He has been classified as a "sexually violent predator".
The defense is expected to take 4 to 5 days for its part of the sentencing phase.
