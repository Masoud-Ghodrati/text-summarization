Wednesday marks 30th anniversary of the Iranian hostage crisis.
Iran is firmly warning against reformists taking to the streets to protest the government.
Security forces chief says the "faithful" will be allowed to to celebrate the anniversary.
Reformists have released names of 72 protesters they say were killed after June elections.
