Chinese investor Lam Kok is feared dead in a helicopter crash in southwest France.
His son's body has been recovered, but police continue to search for Kok and two others.
The vineyard's previous owner, who'd sold the estate to Kok on Thursday, was also aboard.
Kok wanted to tour the vineyard by helicopter, its marketing manager says.
