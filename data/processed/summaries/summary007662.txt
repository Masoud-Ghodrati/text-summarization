Richie McCaw is second New Zealander to lead All Blacks to Rugby World Cup title.
He played through the last three games of the 2011 tournament with a broken foot.
McCaw is taking a six-month sabbatical from rugby in order to extend his playing career.
The 31-year-old is hoping to explore his other passion of flying gliders and planes.
