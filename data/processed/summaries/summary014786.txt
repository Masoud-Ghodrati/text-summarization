Errol Louis: Spitzer making new bid for NYC comptroller; he joins Weiner in arena.
Both had sex scandals, but similarities end there. Spitzer fessed up in his scandal.
But Weiner lied, he says. Spitzer has record of accomplishment. Weiner not so much.
Louis: Weiner in 6-candidate race. Spitzer faces 1 oppenent. Can NYers forgive?.
