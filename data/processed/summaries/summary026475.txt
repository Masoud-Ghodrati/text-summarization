The two victims, both male, worked for Tokyo Electric and were in their 20s.
Their bodies were found in the No. 4 reactor's turbine building, a utility official says.
They had not been seen since the March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Their remains were found Wednesday, but it wasn't announced until Sunday.
