Rivers' personal doctor who did the biopsy was not certified by the clinic, a source says.
The doctor took a selfie while Rivers was under anesthesia, a clinic staffer tells investigators.
Biopsy was done without Rivers' prior consent, the source says.
Rivers died a week after suffering cardiac arrest at the Manhattan clinic.
