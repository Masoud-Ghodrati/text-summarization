Libyan television aired a video of Saadi Gadhafi speaking from Tripoli jail.
Gadhafi's son says he is being treated well, moves arms and smiles in video.
The conditions surrounding the release of the video are unclear.
Human rights activists say they worry legal proceedings won't meet international standards.
