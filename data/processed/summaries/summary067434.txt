Archbishop Athanasios Dawood says the Iraqi government does not protect minorities.
He calls on the British government to grant Christians living in Iraq humanitarian asylum.
His appeal comes one week to the day after a brutal attack on a church in Baghdad.
The church celebrated Mass Sunday as parishioners lit candles for those who died.
