A rights group says it has documented more than 60 cases of torture of civilians in Myanmar.
The alleged torture occurred in Kachin State and northern Shan State over the past three years.
A 17 year ceasefire between the Kachin Independence Army and state forces ended in 2011.
Myanmar's government rejects the report and says torture is not part of military policy.
