NEW: A blast occurs Monday at the Daiichi's plant No. 3 reactor building, an official says.
NEW: The official says he doesn't believe there's been a massive radioactive leak.
IAEA says the radiation near the Onagawa plant "normal," may be from Daiichi.
Authorities have not confirmed meltdowns, because the reactors are so hot.
