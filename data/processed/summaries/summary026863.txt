Obama says U.S. "can't accept" killing of 12 at D.C.'s Navy Yard as "inevitable".
"It ought to be a shock to all of us, as a nation and as a people," Obama says.
Obama honors each victim, noting some of the last things they said before they died.
"Our tears are not enough," Obama tells families of those killed.
