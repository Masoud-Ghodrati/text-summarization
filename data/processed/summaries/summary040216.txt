Multiple sclerosis sufferer Annette Fredskov ran 366 marathons in 365 days.
The Dane says her grueling year helped ease the symptoms of her disease.
The 41-year-old ran a total of 15,442 kilometers and got through 20 pairs of shoes.
"My muscles and bones got stronger during the project," Fredskov tells CNN.
