Egypt asked Turkey's ambassador to leave Saturday.
Turkish media said Egypt attributed the move to Ankara's interference in its affairs.
The Turkish government later declared Egypt's former ambassador unwelcome.
The move follows a worsening in relations since the ousting of President Mohamed Morsy.
