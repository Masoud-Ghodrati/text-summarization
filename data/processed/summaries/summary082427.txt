The winning ticket was bought in the Stevenage and Hitchin area, north of London.
The ticket-holder has only hours left to claim a $103 million jackpot.
The money will go to charitable causes if left unclaimed.
The draw was made on June 8, soon after Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee celebrations.
