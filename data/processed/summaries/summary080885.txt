Mohammed Merah was on the U.S. no-fly list, a U.S. intelligence official says.
President Sarkozy says Merah was not a madman, but a monster and a fanatic.
Merah is shot in the head during a raid by security forces, ending the long standoff.
Police say Merah killed 3 soldiers, a rabbi and 3 Jewish children.
