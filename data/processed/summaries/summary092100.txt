Samir Naji describes conditions in Guantanamo Bay detention camp.
Naji says he was interrogated for three months by two teams, running shifts round the clock.
Interrogators abused him, forced him to look at degrading pornography, he claims.
Treatment shames American flag hanging in the prison corridor, Naji says.
