Yani Tseng survives a tense final round to win Women's British Open by one shot.
Taiwanese golfer's four-stroke lead was eroded by Katherine Hull with five holes to play.
Neither player broke par after that as Tseng recovers following bunkered tee shot at 18.
The 21-year-old became the youngest woman to win three major trophies.
