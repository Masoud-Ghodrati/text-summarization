Chelsea Clinton: "There are so few mysteries in life... in which any answer is a happy one".
Clinton and husband Marc Mezvinsky announced in April they were expecting.
Attention on the child -- Bill and Hillary Clinton's first grandchild -- has been intense.
Bill Clinton told CNN earlier this week that the baby is due around October 1.
