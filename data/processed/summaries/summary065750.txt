Six soldiers and one civilian are convicted in the shooting death of Sarfraz Shah.
One man is sentenced to death, six others to life in prison, prosecutor says.
Those convicted are also ordered to pay restitution to the teen's family.
The sentences still must be confirmed by Pakistan's higher court, prosecutor says.
