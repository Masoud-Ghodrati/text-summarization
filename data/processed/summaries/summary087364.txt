Chris Brown was taken by marshals after an extradition hearing in Los Angeles.
Brown's hopscotch route to Washington on "Con Air" could take up to two weeks.
Con Air is the nickname for the U.S Justice Department's prisoner airplane system.
Brown was jailed in Los Angeles after he was booted from rehab three weeks ago.
