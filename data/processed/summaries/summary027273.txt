The new probe finds that Amy Winehouse died of accidental alcohol poisoning.
Earlier probe that found the same was thrown out when coroner credentials questioned.
The 27-year-old singer was found dead at her home in north London in July 2011.
She had battled with alcohol and drug abuse for several years.
