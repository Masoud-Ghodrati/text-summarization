A woman who worked at a government-funded agency didn't show up for 12 years.
She was paid at least $300,000 over that time span, Norfolk TV station WAVY says.
The Community Services Board is a mental health agency with 40 Virginia locations.
Recent audits of the Norfolk office had shown no problems, says a linked state agency.
