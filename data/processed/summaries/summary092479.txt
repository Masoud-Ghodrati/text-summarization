NEW: The House votes to bar federal funding for National Public Radio.
NPR's website says the broadcaster provides content to 900 independent stations.
The House voted earlier to cut $50 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports NPR.
Past efforts to refund the CPB and NPR have failed.
