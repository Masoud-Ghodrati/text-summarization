Conclave ballots and voting notes are destroyed in a stove placed in the Sistine Chapel.
Chemicals are added to color the smoke to signify whether the ballot has been successful.
White smoke means a pope has been elected, black means the ballot was inconclusive.
John Paul II ordered that the bells of St. Peter's should also be rung if a pope was elected.
