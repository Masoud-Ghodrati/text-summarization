Dean Obeidallah says Obama uses jokes like many comedians do: as weapons.
He says presidents often make self-deprecating jokes, but Obama's can be barbed, too.
He says Obama has aimed at Trump, Romney, Damon like a comic leveling a heckler.
Obeidallah: Style draws from Jon Stewart, which educates, eviscerates.
