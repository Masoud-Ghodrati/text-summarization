The Somali president calls Kenya's incursion to chase down a militant group "not good".
His statement contradicts a joint statement issued by Somalia and Kenya days after the move.
In the statement, the countries called Al-Shabaab a "common enemy".
Kenyan troops are preparing to battle for a key city on their way to the port of Kismayo.
