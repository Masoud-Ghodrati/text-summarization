A tribal council is alleged to have used girls and money to settle a dispute.
Under the tradition, the girls must marry members of the tribe they are handed to.
The Supreme Court has ordered authorities to present the 13 girls on Wednesday.
A provincial lawmaker denies accusations he presided over the tribal council.
