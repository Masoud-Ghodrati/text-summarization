Franciscan nun Sister Doris is one of only a handful of women working in Bavaria's beer industry.
Sister Doris is excused from morning prayers so she can get an early start on her daily brewing routines.
She's reckoned to be the last in a long line of nuns engaged in traditional beer making in Europe.
