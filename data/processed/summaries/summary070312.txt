Man claims to be brother of Christian woman sentenced to death for apostasy in Sudan.
Al-Samani al-Hadi says the woman he claims is his sister should recant or be executed.
Woman's husband says he had never seen al-Hadi before his wife's trial began.
Western leaders have decried the verdict and asked Khartoum to free the woman.
