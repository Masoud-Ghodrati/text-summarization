Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. hasn't been at work on Capitol Hill since May.
His office had announced he's at the Mayo Clinic for depression and GI issues.
His wife tells a newspaper her husband collapsed and had "debilitating" depression.
"My husband has his good days and bad days," she says after a recent visit.
