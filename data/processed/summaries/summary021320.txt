In Yemen, authorities say the story of the death of an 8-year-old bride is false.
Last week, there were reports that she died days after being married off to a 40-year-old man.
Activists calling for the end to such marriages say the story sheds light on the issue.
Yemen should end the practice, Human Rights Watch says, but cultural practices are in the way.
