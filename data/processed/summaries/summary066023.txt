Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda launch a website to help Japan.
The trio were all in their native country when the recent earthquake and tsunami struck.
They have designed a button which will raise awareness of their fundraising side.
The button have been handed out to all the players at this week's LPGA Kia Classic.
