AEG LIve lawyers want another chance to question Katherine Jackson in death trial.
Lawyer: Jackson's mom will be asked "about the absurdity of the damages" she wants.
Judge: Any mother would say "no amount of money would substitute for the loss of a son".
Wrongful death trial closing arguments could be heard next week.
