Felix Baumgartner will have only a space suit, helmet and parachute for 120,000-foot jump.
Record of 102,800 feet was set in 1960 and is held by current mission's consultant and mentor.
Baumgartner also hopes to be first person to break the sound barrier without a vehicle's aid.
Besides speed, risks include low temperatures, thin atmosphere, possible loss of consciousness.
