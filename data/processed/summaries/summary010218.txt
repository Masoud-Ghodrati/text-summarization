Reps. Miller and McMorris Rodgers say kids sometimes restrained abusively in schools.
No federal laws prevent this, they say, and it happens disproportionately to special ed kids.
They say students, teachers, classmates are all harmed by abuse, with lasting effects.
Miller, McMorris Rodgers: New law would train teachers, limit restraint, provide oversight.
