The DOT fines Orbitz for failing to properly disclose baggage fees on its website.
Customers had to scroll to the bottom of the page to find baggage fees, the DOT says.
Orbitz says it has corrected its site "to be consistent with DOT's preference".
"We are not aware of any consumer confusion, complaints or deception," Orbitz says.
