Benedict XVI will keep his name and still be addressed as "his holiness" after he resigns.
He will give up the red mantle and shoes of the pope and dress in a simple white robe.
As he leaves office at 8 p.m. Thursday, the Swiss Guards will leave Castel Gandolfo.
Cardinals are already gathering in Rome ahead of their meeting to choose the pope's successor.
