19 members of a "hotshot" team from Prescott died in an Arizona wildfire Sunday.
Kevin Woyjeck was a son of a Los Angeles County fire captain.
Woyjeck always looked "forward to becoming a firefighter like his dad," dad says.
Andrew Ashcraft, 29, wanted to do hotshot work until he physically couldn't, mom says.
