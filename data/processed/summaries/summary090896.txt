David Gergen: President Obama's State of the Union could be crucial for second term.
He says if Obama doesn't get GOP to the table, we could see high-stakes budget fight.
It would be a mistake for Democrats to think they can win by refusing to negotiate, he says.
He says Obama's shift in tone to more partisan approach is a big mistake.
