The Senate on Monday approved an online sales tax.
Currently online retailers do not have to collect sales taxes outside of the states where they are based.
The Market Place Fairness Act would still need to pass the House before it could become law.
Online shoppers would have to pay the same sales tax as when buying the item at a store.
