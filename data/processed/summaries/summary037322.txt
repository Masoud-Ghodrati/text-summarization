Two people are dead after violent clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar.
Radical Buddhist monks appeared to play a role in inciting mobs, says rights researcher.
Myanmar has had numerous outbursts of anti-Muslim violence in recent years.
The violence threatens the country's fledgling transition from decades of military rule.
