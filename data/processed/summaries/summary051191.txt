Roger Federer's win over Andy Murray equals Pete Sampras' seven-title Wimbledon record.
The Swiss has won 17 grand slam titles -- the most in tennis history -- with Sampras next on 14.
American tennis coach Nick Bollettieri believes Federer could still win as many as four more grand slams.
He says Andy Murray's best chance of winning a grand slam is at the U.S. or Australian Opens.
