LZ Granderson: After John McCain's loss, many assumed Sarah Palin would run in 2012.
He says Palin's decision not to run for president is a smart move.
Whoever wins in 2012 will likely face a weak economy, and will take the blame, he says.
Granderson: Palin will still have a platform for her views and can live the life she wants.
