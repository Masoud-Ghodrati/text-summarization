Michael Green: North Korea more threatening than usual; three scenarios may play out.
1. Nuke threats grow; regime will get U.S. to lift sanctions; regime returns to same tactics.
2. China will turn on North, cut it off; Kim will lose power; North and South reunite sans nukes.
3. Kim will fire on South; U.S. will get involved; North will fall; Japan, South Korea ravaged.
