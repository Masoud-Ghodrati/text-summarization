Madonna has launched a new project titled Art for Freedom.
She talked Thursday with CNN's Anderson Cooper about her project.
She is encouraging people to fight oppression, intolerance and complacency through art.
"It's the most important thing I've ever done, besides raising my children," Madonna says.
