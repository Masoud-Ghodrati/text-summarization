Mary Alice Carr says new Oklahoma abortion law protects doctors who lie from lawsuits.
Doctor may withhold information that he or she believes would prompt an abortion, she says.
The law is paternalistic incursion that violates doctor-patient relationship, she says.
Carr: Oklahoma politicians mock medicine; law should be found unconstitutional.
