Suzie Lopez is one of an estimated 52,000 "Amerasians" fathered by U.S. servicemen in Philippines.
Majority of their mothers worked as bar girls in the area's thriving "rest and recreation" industry.
Many have grown up in poverty experiencing much discrimination along the way.
National Amerasian Day gives Amerasians the opportunity to put their issues in the spotlight.
