NEW: Japan's weather agency issues an emergency warning for remote island area.
"This is a beast," says CNN International Meteorologist Tom Sater.
It's forecast to pass west of Okinawa on Tuesday, sparing the islands its strongest winds.
But U.S. military officials warn the storm is very dangerous and urge personnel to prepare.
