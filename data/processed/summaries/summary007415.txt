Tourist daredevils career down Nicaragua's Cerro Negro on thin boards at speeds up to 95 kph.
Cerro Negro is the world's only "volcano boarding" venue.
Various small companies lead volcano boarding excursions out of the city of Leon.
The sport was invented in 2004 when Daryn Webb rode a small refrigerator down the hill.
