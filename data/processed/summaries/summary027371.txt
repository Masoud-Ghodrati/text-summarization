Henning Frunder was jailed in East Germany after his plans to leave came to attention of Stasi.
When the Wall fell in 1989, Stasi agents tried to destroy records which would reveal informants.
A painstaking operation to piece together more than 600 million pieces of paper continues.
Frunder's name, and the name of the man who betrayed him, were revealed.
