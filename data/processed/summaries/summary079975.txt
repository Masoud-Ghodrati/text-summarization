Children's rights group draws attention to plight of child brides in Yemen.
12-year-old Yemeni girl Fawziya Ammodi died after painful three-day labor.
Fawziya left school and was forced to marry a 24-year-old man in 2008.
More than half of all young Yemeni girls are married off before the age of 18.
