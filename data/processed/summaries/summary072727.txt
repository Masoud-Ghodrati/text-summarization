Italian club Lazio forced to shut a section of their ground for opening Serie A match.
The terrace closure is punishment after Lazio fans were guilty of racist abuse.
Fans in the Curva Nord shouted abuse at black Juventus players during Supercup final.
Juventus player Paul Pogba says abuse "shows a lack of respect".
