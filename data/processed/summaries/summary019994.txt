Katharine McPhee is working with Malaria No More to end malaria deaths by 2015.
McPhee's fight against malaria started when a woman she knew in Burkina Faso got sick.
McPhee and a team from Malaria No More traveled to Burkina Faso and Ghana to help.
A dollar donation to the "Power of One" campaign pays for a course of malaria treatment.
