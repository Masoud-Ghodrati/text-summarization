Zaha Hadid has designed a Cambodian genocide memorial.
The Sleuk Rith Institute will commemorate the 2 million Cambodians killed by the Khmer Rouge regime.
The light-filled towers are a departure from the dark designs typically associated with genocide memorials.
Hadid was inspired by Cambodia's "Citadel of Women" temple.
