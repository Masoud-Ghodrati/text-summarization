NEW: Device was meant to be put on a U.S.-bound airline, says U.S. Rep. Peter King.
The intended user of the bomb in no longer a threat, officials says.
A senior U.S. official says the device points to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
The device was seized abroad, and the plot was discovered before it threatened any airliners.
