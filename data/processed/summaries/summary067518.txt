West Bromwich Albion have sacked manager Roberto di Matteo with immediate effect.
The Italian loses his job following a run of results that has left them near the drop zone.
Albion started the season well, winning at Arsenal and drawing at Manchester United.
But they have struggled recently and have picked up just three wins in 18 matches.
