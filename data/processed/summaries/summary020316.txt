Police affidavit: Richard Kirk bought marijuana candy hours before his wife was killed.
Denver Police Chief Robert White says he's opened an internal review into the response.
For nearly 13 minutes, Kristine Kirk spoke to a 911 operator -- until a gunshot rang out.
After the gunshot, an affidavit says, "screaming stopped," but she was "never heard from again".
