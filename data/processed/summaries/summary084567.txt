83 claims have been filed by those wounded and the families of those killed at Fort Hood.
They name the Army, the FBI and the Justice and Defense departments.
The Army has six months to act on the claim before it goes to court, an attorney says.
A court-martial for the suspect, Maj. Nidal Hasan, is set for March.
