Thomas "T.E." McHale: Dan Wheldon was more than a superb driver -- he was a hero.
McHale says Wheldon treated all hospitality staff members as his equals; his death was tragic.
He wore a genuine smile and shared his spirit with all who wanted a part of it, McHale says.
McHale calls Wheldon's spirit "something far more valuable than an autograph or a photo".
