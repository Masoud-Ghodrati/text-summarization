David Bianculli: Bill Cosby made TV history with starring roles in "I Spy," "The Cosby Show".
He says there's news he'll be, at 76, in a new TV show. Can lightning strike thrice?.
He says despite Cosby's two ground-breaking shows, he's had quite a few that have failed.
Bianculli: He can score again, but only if NBC lets him swing for fences. He's still hilarious.
