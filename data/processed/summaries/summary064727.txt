The new Windows 8 operating system is available after midnight Thursday.
It can be downloaded online, shipped or you can buy a new computer with it pre-installed.
The new interface, which is for tablets and PCs, is fun but takes some getting used to.
Existing Windows users can upgrade for $40 online.
