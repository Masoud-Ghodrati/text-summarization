Ali Lamu turns old fishing material and recycled items into artwork and handicrafts.
The handmade creations are mostly made by old dhow sails, or 'tanga' in Swahili.
The artisans paint thoughtful messages on the creations promoting love and peace.
Clients can buy Ali Lamu's offerings from a small boutique on the island or online.
