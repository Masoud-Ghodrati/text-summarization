NEW: "We want to know what happened," says the uncle of murder victim Anni Dewani.
A UK court rules Shrien Dewani should be sent to South Africa for trial.
He denies hiring hit men to kill his new bride in Cape Town.
A South African official welcomes the ruling and says Dewani will get a fair trial.
