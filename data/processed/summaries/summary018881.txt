Mark NeJame: Many have said George Zimmerman engaged in racial profiling.
He says civilians aren't subject to same restrictions as police officers face.
Evidence doesn't support the claim that his actions were racially motivated, NeJame says.
He says case may not hold up in criminal court, may go to civil lawsuit.
