Manchester United take on Real Madrid in the European Champions League this week.
The two teams first met back in 1957 when Real prevailed 5-3 on aggregate.
United boss Matt Busby tried to flood the Old Trafford pitch to make it a mud bath.
Real launched a protest and threatened to pull out of the contest.
