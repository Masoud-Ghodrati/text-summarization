NEW: Chavez says the expulsion of Livia Acosta was "unfair" and "immoral".
He calls for an "administrative closing" of the consulate in Miami.
The move follows the U.S. decision to expel Acosta, consul general in Miami.
Last month, a group of American lawmakers called for an investigation of the diplomat.
