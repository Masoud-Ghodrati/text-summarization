India carried out a test flight of a long-range nuclear-capable missile last week.
Pakistan says it has launched a new version of a medium-range missile into the sea.
The test will strengthen the country's "deterrence abilities," the Pakistani military says.
There have been positive signs in relations between Islamabad and New Delhi recently.
