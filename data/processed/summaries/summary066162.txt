Tyler Perry is the first African-American to own a major film and TV studio.
The director, writer and playwright grew up poor in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Perry's movies have grossed nearly $400 million; he's developed loyal following.
"[If] this little boy from Louisiana can do it, anybody can do it," says Perry.
