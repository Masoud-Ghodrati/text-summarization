An election committee of 1,200 Hong Kong people will choose new Chief Executive.
Hong Kong residents do not vote but the winning candidate is supposed to be "acceptable" to them.
The two main candidates are 59-year-old Henry Tang and 58-year-old C Y Leung.
But both candidates have been mired in controversy, making the race increasingly hostile.
