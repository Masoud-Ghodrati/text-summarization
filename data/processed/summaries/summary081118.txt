Brazil's president offered to save Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's life.
She is condemned to die by stoning after being convicted of adultery in 2006.
A human rights activist said she hoped the world would keep up pressure on Iran.
She wrote a letter to Lula saying Brazil's offer was an "important step".
