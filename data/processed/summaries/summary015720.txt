European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federal Europe is "unavoidable".
European institutions are already moving toward a more unified Europe in attempts to stem crisis.
Barroso's call is the latest in a long line of measures taken by European politicians.
According to Barroso, integration is the only way to compete on the global stage.
