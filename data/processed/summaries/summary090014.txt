Soul Food Farm is highly prized by customers, including fine restaurants.
Chickens raised there feed in vast fields and live a relatively stress-free existence.
A fire in September 2009 killed more than 1,200 chicks at the farm.
Friends got together to raise more than $30,000 to help save the farm.
