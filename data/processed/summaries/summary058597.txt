Bram Stoker's journal has been found in a home on Isle of Wight, England.
The journal contains notes that would inform Stoker's "Dracula" and other works.
An annotated book will be published 100 years after Stoker's 1912 death.
Dacre Stoker, the author's great-grandnephew, shared excerpts with CNN.com.
