Tens of thousands of people are trying to escape militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
Many of them are Yazidis, who fled into the Sinjar Mountains last week.
Members of the religious sect worship an angel figure held by many Muslims to be the devil.
Sources say as many as 20,000 have been able to leave the mountains, but many remain.
