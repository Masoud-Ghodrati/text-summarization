S.E. Cupp: Some speculated that winning wasn't Anthony Weiner's goal.
He could have wanted to help his wife's career or raise his visibility for future roles, she says.
Cupp: Whatever the goal, Weiner's campaign was an embarrassment.
He said he wanted a campaign of ideas; we got a campaign of idiotic outbursts.
