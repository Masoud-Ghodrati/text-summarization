Scott Lilly: McGovern presciently rode swirling political, social currents of late '60s, early '70s.
His views on foreign policy, women's rights and more drew support of young, Lilly says.
McGovern lost to Nixon in 1972, but many of his positions came to pass anyway, Lilly says.
Lilly: McGovern not the extremist his opponents claimed; he was a man of strength, grace.
