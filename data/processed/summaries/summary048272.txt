Every year thousands of volunteers join the "Africa Mercy" hospital ship in Africa.
Volunteers are also asked to become "walking blood banks," donating on call.
Mercy Ships have served in 150 ports in developing nations around the world.
They are mobile hospitals that provide free surgery to world's poorest people.
