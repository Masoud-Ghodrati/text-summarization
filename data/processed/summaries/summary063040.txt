The trial of Aaron Deveau, now 18, began this week in Haverhill, Massachusetts.
Authorities say he was texting before a fatal crash, then erased some of the texts.
The defense argues authorities had an agenda in trying to link texting with the crash.
The teen had told police after the incident, "I was tired, I was distracted".
