Thousands chant anti-government chants at cleric's funeral.
Senior Iranian dissident cleric Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri died Sunday.
Montazeri was one of several prominent clerics who publicly criticized the presidential elections last June.
Montazeri was once heir apparent to late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, architect of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
