Many children and teens in eastern Kentucky have lost a parent to drug overdose.
"Without a normal mom and dad, you feel different," one teen says.
Kentucky is the fourth most medicated state in the nation and sixth for overdoses.
A drug task force aims to help children left behind by parents' addictions.
