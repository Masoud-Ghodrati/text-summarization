AP report said Benjamin Netanyahu had warned John Kerry on second-guessing him.
Netanyahu doesn't deny it, but says the report missed the general "tone" of the calls.
"I think the United States has been terrific," Netanyahu adds.
Sources say the Obama and Netanyahu administrations are at odds over Gaza.
