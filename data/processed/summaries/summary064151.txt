Council graffiti team in Clacton-on-Sea removes a Banksy image from a seafront building.
The image showed pigeons directing anti-immigration signs toward an exotic-looking bird.
An election is taking place after a local MP defected to UKIP, which wants to limit migration.
Council spokesman says Banksy is welcome to return any time to do an "appropriate" work.
