Hundreds of a radical Shiite cleric's supporters demonstrate in Baghdad's Sadr City.
"America is the enemy of the people," they chant, while railing against an anti-Islam video.
The controversial video was made in the U.S., but the top U.S. diplomat calls it "disgusting".
Protests tied to the video are also held elsewhere in Iraq, including Najaf and Karbala.
