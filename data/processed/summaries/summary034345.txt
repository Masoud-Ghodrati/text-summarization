Daniel Jones and his wife, Cathi, aren't romantic; they don't ever remember their anniversary.
Jones edits a "love" column in which strangers tell tales of swooning love, romantic longing.
Their marriage has lasted 22 years without the flowers and the chocolates, he says.
Jones: They support each other, laugh and talk together, and make a good pair of parents.
