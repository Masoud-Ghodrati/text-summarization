Anderson has driven American media coverage of the church abuse scandal.
In 1983, he was one of the only lawyers in the country taking on such cases.
He has been a key figure in bulk of settlements U.S. Catholic Church has paid out.
Critics: Anderson's work is aimed more at attracting publicity than getting justice.
