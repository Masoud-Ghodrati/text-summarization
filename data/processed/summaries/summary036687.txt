Denmark has unveiled a controversial de-radicalization program for jihadis returning from Syria.
The program offers some returning foreign fighters social support without the threat of jail time.
Denmark has one of the highest proportions of citizens leaving for Syria in Europe.
Danish program lies in stark contrast to UK's more punitive approach to returning fighters.
