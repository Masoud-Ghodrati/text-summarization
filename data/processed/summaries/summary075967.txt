Britain's Prince William and Catherine arrive in New York City for a whirlwind tour Sunday.
The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will not be accompanied by Prince George.
A source says the program of events in the city "doesn't make it appropriate to bring him".
Prince William will travel to Washington to meet U.S. President Barack Obama.
