Dzhokar Tsarnaev's attorneys want a court to suppress comments he made in a hospital.
In a motion, lawyers say bombing suspect begged for rest and requested a lawyer at least 10 times.
Tsarnaev, 20, is accused of planting bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.
His trial is set for early November, with the government seeking the death penalty.
