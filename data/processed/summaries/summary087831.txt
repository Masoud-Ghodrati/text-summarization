Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan was a top intelligence official in Lebanon.
Aligned with an anti-Syrian, anti-Hezbollah faction, he led many probes into assassinations.
Fellow Sunnis saw him as an icon, while he was despised by others.
A scholar linked to the opposition calls al-Hassan a "master" who will be difficult to replace.
