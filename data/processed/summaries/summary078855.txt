Arduino, the open source electronic hardware, hails from Ivrea, the home of Olivetti.
Olivetti was once at the forefront of Italian technology and designed the world's first PC.
There are now more than 700,000 Arduino boards in the hands of hobbyists and professionals.
An Arduino circuit board will go on display at MoMA in New York in 2015.
