Christian Minard was expelled from Southwestern Christian University.
She was told her marriage to another woman conflicted with the school's "lifestyle covenant".
Another university in Oklahoma has now accepted Minard for fall classes.
Minard says she learned a vital lesson: "To always stand up for what you believe in".
