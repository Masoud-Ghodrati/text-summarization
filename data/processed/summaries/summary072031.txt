The 100th anniversary of Ronald Reagan's birth is February 6, 2011.
David Frum says Washington has honored him inappropriately, with a building, an airport.
He says the real monument to Reagan would be a museum honoring victims of communism.
Reagan's great cause was to fight against communist regimes, Frum says.
