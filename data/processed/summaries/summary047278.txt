Justin Bieber's monkey, Mally, confiscated by German officials, is now living in a zoo.
Mally is being introduced to a family of fellow capuchin monkeys.
Bieber had until May 7 to reclaim his pet with the right paperwork but didn't, the zoo says.
The singer wanted to take the monkey on his European tour but it was seized in Munich.
