Jibo, a personal robot, has been launched by robotics pioneer Cynthia Breazeal.
The robot is designed to be an organizer, educator and assist family members.
CNN's Maggie Lake met him and says she was impressed with his skills.
But the Jibo up for grabs is just a prototype -- so don't expect too much.
