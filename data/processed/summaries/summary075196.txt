The iPad faces stiff competition from the Kindle Fire and Nook tablets next week.
Kindle Fire, priced at $199, may be the most succesful tablet since the iPad.
The full-color 7-inch tablet has access to millions of movies, songs, books and magazines.
Barnes & Noble's $249 Nook tablet may also prove popular.
