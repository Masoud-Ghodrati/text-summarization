Amid all the bad news, there's a sign of progress in Afghanistan, says Peter Bergen.
Bergen: A national unity government has agreed to a continuing U.S. presence.
He says Afghan leaders are making calls opposite to what Iraq's al-Maliki did.
Bergen: Afghanistan's economy could benefit from signs of greater stability.
