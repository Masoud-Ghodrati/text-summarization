Amazon recently came out with its "100 Books to Read in a Lifetime".
Jay Parini: I was more than a little shocked by the list, which crudely mixes categories.
If you're going to die soon, he suggests reading "Walden" by Henry David Thoreau.
Parini: Only about a third of the books on the Amazon list are in any way must-reads.
