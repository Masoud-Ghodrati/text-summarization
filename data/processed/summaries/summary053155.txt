Reading's Jason Roberts will refuse to wear an anti-racism groups t-shirt.
The striker's move is a protest against a lack of action from the group Kick It Out.
Former EPL player Vicent Pericard questions Roberts' move and calls for unity.
Kick It Out and UEFA both hosting anti-racism weeks designed to raise awareness.
