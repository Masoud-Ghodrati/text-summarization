The first stem cell burger was cooked and eaten by two volunteer tasters in London.
The burger was made of 20,000 small strands of meat grown from a cow's muscle cells.
The five ounce cultured beef burger took three months and cost $330,000 to develop.
A volunteer taster said the burger was "close to meat but misses salt and pepper".
