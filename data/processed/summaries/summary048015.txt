Ron Sparks comes out on top in Democratic primary for Alabama's gubernatorial race.
Major black political groups backed Sparks; Davis declined to solicit endorsements.
Davis was only member of Congressional Black Caucus to vote against health care bill.
"We don't have to have the past dictate our future," Davis said when he announced his bid.
