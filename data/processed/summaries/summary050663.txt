Jimmy Savile was a hugely popular television and radio host in the UK.
Since his death in 2011, he has been accused of dozens of counts of child abuse.
Kevin Cook says he was abused by Savile when he appeared on his show in 1974.
The allegations are the subject of investigations by the police and the BBC.
