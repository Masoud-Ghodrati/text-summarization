Former WADA chief Richard Pound says sport must crack down on doping.
Cycling has been rocked by Lance Armstrong being stripped of seven Tour de France titles.
The UCI attempted to sue Pound in 2007 for comments he made about the organization.
The 100th Tour de France will be the first in 10 years to take place entirely with French borders.
