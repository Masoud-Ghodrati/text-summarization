O.J. Simpson had asked for a new trial, 5 years after his robbery, kidnapping conviction.
He cited 22 specific grounds, chiefly saying that his lawyers failed to represent him well.
The Nevada judge rules against him, pointing to "the overwhelming amount of evidence".
One of Simpson's current lawyers says "we're shocked and disappointed".
