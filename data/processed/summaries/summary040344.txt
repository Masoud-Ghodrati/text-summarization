Peace negotiations are to start Monday night in Washington, the U.S. State Department says.
Israel plans to release 104 Palestinian prisoners, starting next week.
Any peace plan would have to be approved by a vote of Israelis, Israel's Cabinet says.
The goal of the talks is to agree to a Palestinian state's borders, make security arrangements.
