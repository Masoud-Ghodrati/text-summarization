The store clerk doubles over after the bullet hits him, a surveillance video shows.
He survived without serious injury because his cell phone blocked it.
"The bullet didn't go through, but it hit him," his co-worker says in a 911 call.
The shooting happened during an attempted robbery at a gas station in Florida.
