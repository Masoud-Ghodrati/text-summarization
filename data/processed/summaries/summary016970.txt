Takuma Sakuragi, a 71-year-old lawmaker, is facing drugs charges in China.
He is accused of trying to board a flight with 3.2kg of methamphetamine in luggage.
The charges carry the death penalty in China, which executed a Japanese trafficker in July.
Sakuragi has pleaded not guilty, saying he was helping take a friend's luggage.
