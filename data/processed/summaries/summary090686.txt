Five teenagers are accused in the burning of a Florida boy.
Mother of 2 suspects apologizes, says crime "should have never had occurred".
Doctors say victim, burned on about 65 percent of his body, is on ventilator, expected to live.
Because he is sedated and on ventilator, victim hasn't communicated with detectives.
