Chinese architect Ma Yansong's favorite design is the Absolute Towers in Mississauga, Ontario.
Locals have nicknamed the twisting residential towers "Marilyn Monroe" on account of their sinuous curves.
The building he wishes he'd designed is Louis Kahn's Salk Institute in La Jolla, California.
Ma aims to combine high-rise and high-density environments with nature, he says.
