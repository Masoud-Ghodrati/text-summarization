Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza faces 11 terrorism-related charges in the United States.
He'd challenged efforts to extradite him from Britain, but a European court rules against him.
4 others also can be extradited, including Adel Abdul Bary, who could get 269 life sentences.
The U.S. is "pleased" and will work to extradite the 5 terror suspects, a spokesman says.
