Gayle Sulik: The test to find if you have BRCA1 gene mutation that raises cancer risk is costly.
Sulik says that's because Myriad Genetics owns the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.
She says Myriad has monopoly and aggressively markets often unnecessary test.
Supreme Court expected to rule next month whether Myriad, or any company, can own genes.
