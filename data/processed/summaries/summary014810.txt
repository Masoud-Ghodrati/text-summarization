Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was in an accident in 2012.
She drove away from the accident scene, and was found collapsed in her SUV.
She is on trial on a misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated.
Kennedy says she took what she thought was medicine but it could have been a sleep aid.
