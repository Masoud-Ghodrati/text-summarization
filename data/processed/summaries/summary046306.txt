NEW: Last month nearly three-quarters of Americans said they support the U.S. pulling out.
A total of 650 U.S. Army soldiers left the northeastern province of Parwan on Wednesday.
This is the first group of soldiers whose redeployment will not be replaced.
Another 600 troops are in the process of leaving.
