The queen will be carried aboard a specially converted royal barge, draped in red and gold.
More than 1,000 boats of all shapes and sizes are taking part in the pageant on the Thames.
Large crowds are expected to line the riverbanks as they pass, despite a rainy forecast.
The river pageant is part of four days of celebrations for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.
