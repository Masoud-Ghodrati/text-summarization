Weather in the ITCZ, where the Air France plane went down, is volatile.
The zone circles the Earth near the equator and can produce violent thunderstorms.
These storms contain updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.
Because the storms are so huge, it can be difficult for airliners to avoid them.
