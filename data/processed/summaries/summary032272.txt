The entrepreneur grew up with little, but a love of radio gave him the incentive to improve his circumstances.
Denied a radio license three times, he eventually set up what would become the biggest private radio station in Malawi.

The station supports female students in Malawi and has an scholarship fund sending women to international universities.
