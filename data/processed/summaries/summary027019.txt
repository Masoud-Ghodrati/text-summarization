Ruben Navarrette: Drug violence has become so common in Mexico, some are used to it.
He says some blame President Felipe Calderon, saying he should leave drug cartels alone.
He says Calderon not perfect, but other problem is Mexicans' romanticization of drug outlaws.
Navarrette: Mexicans share responsibility, should not be on side of drug lords in the battle.
