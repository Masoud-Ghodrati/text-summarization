Deputy Prime Minister's Office official: He'll work with government on economic affairs.
The appointment will be announced Tuesday, the Serbian official says.
He resigned as IMF chief in 2011 after being charged with sexual assault in New York.
The charges in New York were eventually dropped, and Strauss-Kahn settled a civil case.
