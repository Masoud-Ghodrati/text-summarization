Inmarsat and Malaysian authorities release data from MH370-satellite communications.
Plane sent "handshake" signals for six hours after it disappeared in March 2014.
Inmarsat vice president Mark Dickinson says data has been checked and checked again.
Lengthy searches in the southern Indian Ocean have so far found no trace of the plane.
