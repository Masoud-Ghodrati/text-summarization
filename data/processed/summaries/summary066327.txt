Formula One legend Niki Lauda defied his wealthy family to pursue a career in racing.
The Austrian impressed tough team boss Enzo Ferrari despite criticizing his car.
After a life-threatening crash in 1976, Lauda got back in the car after just 42 days.
He would go on to win two more world titles before retiring a second time in 1985.
