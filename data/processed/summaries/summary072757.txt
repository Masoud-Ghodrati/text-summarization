Shimon Peres blames Iran and Hezbollah for an attack that killed 5 Israelis.
The president won't confirm Israel has been killing Iranian nuclear scientists.
Israel will act on its own to secure Syria's chemical weapons if necessary, he vows.
The country will not allow Syrian refugees to flood in amid the violence there, he says.
