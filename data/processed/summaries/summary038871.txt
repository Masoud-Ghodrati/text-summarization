Maine Troop Greeters welcome soldiers and Marines at Bangor International Airport.
The mission includes troops returning from or heading to a war zone.
"It makes me feel good," says one soldier headed out on his first deployment.
Troops also are offered snacks and the use of a cell phone to call their loved ones.
