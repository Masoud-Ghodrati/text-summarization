Franklin McCain, who died Thursday, was one of the "Greensboro Four".
In 1960, four black students defied segregation by sitting at a whites-only lunch counter.
The act spawned sit-ins elsewhere and was hailed as a major desegregation effort.
"We wanted to be included in the round table of humanity," said another of the four.
