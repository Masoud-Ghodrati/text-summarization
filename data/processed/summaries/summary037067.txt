Four jurors gave sworn statements to help Katherine Jackson get a new trial.
The trial ended with a victory for the concert promoter that Jackson's family had sued.
One juror called the verdict form "a trap that prevented us from deliberating on the real issues".
"I do not think that justice was achieved in this case," another jurors says.
