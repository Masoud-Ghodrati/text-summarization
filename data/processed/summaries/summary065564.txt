Pvt. Joseph Foster was doing paperwork when he heard a shout, then gunfire.
Shooter "stood up and yelled 'Allahu akbar' in Arabic and he opened fire," he says.
He says he was too consumed by adrenaline to think about being shot in the hip.
Foster, who has a wife and two young children, said he still plans to deploy to Afghanistan.
