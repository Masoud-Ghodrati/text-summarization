Eric Liu: Tom Perkins' joking suggestion about giving rich more votes is not far from truth.
He says wealthy command more media attention, give far more campaign contributions.
Rich are more likely to turn out to vote and to be represented by lobbyists, Liu says.
Liu: Perkins' "joke" may help prompt outrage and change in the system.
