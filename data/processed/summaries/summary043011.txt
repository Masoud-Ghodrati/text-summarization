Geoff Adams-Spink has been campaigning for justice for the global thalidomide community.
"The battle for financial redress will not end with this apology," he says..
"Thalidomide has deprived us of the lives we should have had and many more of any life at all.".
He says the company should put their wealth at the disposal of the world's thalidomide survivors.
