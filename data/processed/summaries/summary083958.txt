Engineers fly from U.S. to Dominican Republic 4 days after quake, drive to Haiti.
They find 4 power plants off line, power lines down, 56-ton transformers off their bases.
Before the quake, only 60% of capital's residents had electricity; 40% nationwide.
With scant safety supplies and tools, team and Haitians restore service to 25% of customers.
