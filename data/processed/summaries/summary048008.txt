Alyce Zeoli, a Buddhist leader, pressed interstate stalking charges against William Cassidy.
Cassidy published more than 8,000 tweets about Zeoli often wishing death upon her.
The judge dismissed Cassidy's indictment because it violated the First Amendment.
Judge says the amendment protects free speech and didn't constitute a 'true threat'.
