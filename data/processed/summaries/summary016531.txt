A Defense agency is working on a surveillance robotic hawk that could fly through an urban combat jungle at 45mph.
The study is looking at developing new algorithms to allow a small UAV to operate without a remote pilot.
The algorithms developed in the program could enhance other unmanned missions, including marine environments.
