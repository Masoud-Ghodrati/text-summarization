Doctors: Sugar is the body's preferred food, but we eat too much of it.
Added sugars need to be monitored instead of naturally occurring ones.
The American Heart Association says six teaspoons of added sugar is the daily limit for women.
The AHA recommends that men get no more than nine teaspoons of added sugar daily.
