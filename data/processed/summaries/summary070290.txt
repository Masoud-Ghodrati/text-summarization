Kaori Matsumoto is the first Japanese woman judoka to win Olympic gold in 57 kg division.
She was the only member of Japan's judo team to claim a title at London 2012.
One of her coaches describes her as being "like Peter Pan, with a heart of a young boy".
Matsumoto is known for fighting with her "wild" spirit rather than technique.
