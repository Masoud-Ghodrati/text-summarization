Elizabeth Warren told Bill Moyers in 2004 that she briefed Hillary Clinton about bankruptcy.
Clinton helped veto a bankruptcy bill. "I never had a smarter student," Warren said.
Warren said as senator, Clinton changed position because of the financial services industry.
The 2004 exchange shows how Warren's changed, too -- she's now less candid about Clinton.
