NEW: Warring sides in South Sudan agree to peace talks, a U.N. representative says.
Rebels and government troops are fighting in Bor and Bentiu towns.
The rebels are loyal to former South Sudan Vice President Riek Machar.
President Salva Kiir has said his forces "will fight" if Machar will not agree to talk.
