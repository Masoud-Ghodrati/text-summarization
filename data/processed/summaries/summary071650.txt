House committee votes to cite Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt.
Holder is first attorney general to face a potential contempt citation.
Other White House officials, most recently under Bush, have been cited for contempt.
If the House votes Holder in contempt, the House General Counsel could pursue legal action.
