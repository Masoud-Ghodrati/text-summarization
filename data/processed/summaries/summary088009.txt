A U.S. and Yemeni special forces raid last week freed hostages but not the American.
Luke Somers is a photojournalist who was captured in September 2013.
Special forces planned the raid, when AQAP militants were seen transferring hostages.
The militants had split the hostages into two groups two days before the raid.
