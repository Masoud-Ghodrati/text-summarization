For $3,000, couples getting married at W hotels can hire a "social media concierge".
The concierge will live-tweet the entire affair and make sure guests use the same hashtag.
Hotel staffer: "We've even had people ask us how they can get their wedding to 'trend' ".
The service is available at four W hotels in New York.
