Ray Kurzweil, acclaimed futurist and inventor, says we can program ourselves away from disease and aging.
Kurzweil also believes we will be able to satisfy all our energy needs by solar power by 2030.
We will also be printing a significant amount of the goods we use and wear, and replacement organs.
Work and play will become a fully immersive experience by the 2030s, Kurzweil says.
