Hostage's release prompts speculation that the French may have done a deal.
French hostage Serge Lazarevic is freed after being held by al Qaeda in Mali.
Francois Hollande says there are no longer any French hostages held anywhere.
"He is relatively healthy, despite the very harsh conditions of his long captivity," says Hollande.
