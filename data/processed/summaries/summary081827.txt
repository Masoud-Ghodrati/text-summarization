NEW: Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone thanked Pope Benedict for his service.
The pontiff will later celebrate an Ash Wednesday mass at St. Peter's Basilica.
Benedict cites age and frailty as the reasons for his surprise resignation.
His successor as pope will be chosen at a conclave of cardinals in March.
