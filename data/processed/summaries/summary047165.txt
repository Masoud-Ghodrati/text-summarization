Richard Gabriel: Recent failed execution makes the case against death penalty.
The last public execution in the United States was in 1936, witnessed by 20,000 people.
Gabriel says he believes there is no humane way to kill another person.
We should be willing, he says, to live with the byproducts of our retribution.
