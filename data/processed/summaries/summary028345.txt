Five people have been killed as Egyptians protest a presidential edict and draft constitution.
The decree gave President Morsy unchecked power until a new constitution was in place.
Morsy has been locked in a power struggle with factions of the old regime.
Demonstrators accuse him of acting like autocratic former president Mubarak.
