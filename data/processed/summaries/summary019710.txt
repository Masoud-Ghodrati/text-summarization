Utah's tax commission says that same-sex couples can file joint returns for 2013.
The shift affects those married in other states, plus about 1,000 married in Utah.
Those marriages came after a federal judge struck the state's same-sex marriage ban.
The Supreme Court stayed the ruling; state officials have been fighting to keep the ban.
