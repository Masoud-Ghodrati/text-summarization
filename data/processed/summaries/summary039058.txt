A 28-year-old woman falls about 2,000 feet after her parachute fails to open properly.
She and her husband of two weeks had hiked up a mountain in Zion National Park.
He was unable to reach her and had to seek help from park authorities to recover her body.
She was an experienced BASE jumper, but the activity is illegal in the park, authorities say.
