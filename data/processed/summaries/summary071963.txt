Protesters are angry at alleged government censorship at the Southern Weekly in China.
They claim editorial calling for political reform was re-written as tribute to Communist Party.
Government censorship has never stopped and most media groups are still owned by state.
Chinese officials say government protects press freedom according to the law.
