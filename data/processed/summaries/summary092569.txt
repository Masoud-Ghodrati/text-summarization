Hillary Clinton gets a gift from the Republicans as she rolls out her book.
David Gergen says Eric Cantor's defeat is a big plus for Clinton if she runs in 2016.
He says it diminishes the chance that she would face a GOPer with appeal to moderates.
Gergen: By placing immigration reform in jeopardy, the upset hurts GOP's 2016 appeal.
