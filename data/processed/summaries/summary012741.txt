"Saying Grace" first appeared on a Thanksgiving issue of The Saturday Evening Post.
It shows an elderly woman and a small boy praying in a crowded restaurant.
It sells at auction for $46 million -- a record for the late artist Norman Rockwell's work.
Sotheby's says it's also a record price for a single American painting.
