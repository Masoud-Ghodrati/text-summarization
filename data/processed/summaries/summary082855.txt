NEW: Sources: U.S., Russia disagree over how to determine if Syria is meeting its obligations.
Some countries may ask rebels to attack international inspectors, al-Assad says.
"We cannot know until the inspectors arrive in Syria," he tells China's CCTV.
The U.S.-Russian plan for Syria's chemical disarmament calls for inspections soon.
