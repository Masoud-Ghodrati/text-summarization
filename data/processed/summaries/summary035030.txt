First officer found sleeping at controls of a Transavia 737, says Dutch airline.
Returning from a bathroom break, the pilot couldn't immediately enter the cockpit.
He eventually gained access, and the plane landed safely in Amsterdam.
The incident took place in September en route from Greece, Dutch officials say.
