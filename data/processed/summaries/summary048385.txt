Supreme Court's latest ruling means Troy Davis will continue to sit on death row.
Davis was convicted in 1991 of murdering a Savannah, Georgia, police officer.
Since his conviction, 7 of 9 witnesses against him have recanted their testimony.
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas objected to the court's decision.
