NEW: A man accepted a warning related to the alleged incident, London police say.
Nigella Lawson and her children have moved out of their home, a spokesman says.
Lawson's husband, Charles Saatchi, denies a report that he attacked her.
Sunday People published photos of Saatchi's hand apparently holding Lawson's neck.
