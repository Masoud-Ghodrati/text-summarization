1,500 women in Ireland were subjected to symphysiotomy operations from the 1940s to 80s.
Victims say the procedure, administered during childbirth, left them with broken pelvises and lifelong injuries.
Some women were never consulted or told about the procedure; campaigners want an official apology.
