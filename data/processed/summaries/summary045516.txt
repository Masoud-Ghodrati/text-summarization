A virologist says the trial is an essential first step and justifies some optimism.
All 20 volunteers in the first clinical trial of the vaccine produced anti-Ebola antibodies.
None of the volunteers suffered serious side effects, the National Institutes of Health says.
The vaccine carries genetic material from the virus, but there's no risk of Ebola infection.
