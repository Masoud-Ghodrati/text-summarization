David Frum: Tea party extremism contaminates the Republican brand.
He cites a Gallup poll saying that 60% of Americans favor creation of a third party.
Most of the time, third parties are formed by the extreme wings of the parties, he says.
Frum: If the tea party bolts the GOP, it would be a positive sign for Republicans.
