Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says Afghan progress is due to U.S. sacrifices.
Panetta says Hamid Karzai should express "his thanks for the sacrifices".
Karzai drew the ire of Panetta with complaints about the U.S. fight on terror.
The United States is not doing enough to fight terror in Pakistan, Karzai says.
