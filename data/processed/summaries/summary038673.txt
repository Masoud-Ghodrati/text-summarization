Ancient Egyptian mummies kept in storage for years are now on display at Oxford's Ashmolean Museum.
The mummies and artifacts received careful conservation work as part of the museum's redevelopment plan.
Exhibition highlights include CT scan of almost 3,000-year-old mummy and freestanding Pharaonic monument.
The museum's ancient Egyptian and Nubian collection is considered one of the strongest in the world.
