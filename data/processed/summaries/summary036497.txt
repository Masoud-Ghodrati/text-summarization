Real Madrid and Barcelona locked on 77 points at the top of the Spanish league table.
Real have slight edge by just one goal on "for-and-against" differential with eight games left.
Both teams' coaches insist that victory will not decide the La Liga crown.
Defending champions Barcelona won the 79th "El Clasico" 1-0 at home in November.
