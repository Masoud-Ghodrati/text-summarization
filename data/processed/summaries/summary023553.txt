Justice Department sought search warrants for electronic communication of Fox News reporter in connection with leak investigation.
Investigation focused on State Department contractor who may have been in contact with reporter.
The reporter has never been charged and as of late 2009, the government apparently had no interest going after him.
Attorney General Eric Holder has come under fire for Justice Department handling of the case.
