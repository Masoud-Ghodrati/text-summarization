The opera house restaged the show as a concert after opening-night complaints.
Some people were said to be so horrified by the premiere they needed medical help.
Shocking scenes in the opening show included a Nazi-era firing squad and gas chamber.
Director Burkhard Kosminski did not want to change the staging, the opera house said.
