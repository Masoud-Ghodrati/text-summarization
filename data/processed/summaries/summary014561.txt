A judicial panel has reinserted a stoning provision into a draft law, Human Rights Watch says.
The group says Iranian authorities are holding at least 10 people who face stoning.
The U.S. State Department cites unconfirmed reports of bodies of four women apparently stoned.
Officials in Iran have denied the reports.
