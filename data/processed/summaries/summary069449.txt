An urn with Freed's ashes is moved from its spot at the Cleveland museum Friday.
His son says the museum is "disrespectful" to his father's legacy as a rock 'n' roll pioneer.
"We are conscious of his important role and will continue to honor him," hall director says.
Ashes are being removed just days after the museum opens a Beyonce exhibit.
