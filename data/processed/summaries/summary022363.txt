Abigail Thernstrom: President Obama's 2012 statement on case was a mistake.
She says Obama wrongly emphasized role of race in the case.
Presidents should be above the stance of those who seek to stir racial tension, she says.
Thernstrom: Federal charges vs. Zimmerman would exacerbate the race issue.
