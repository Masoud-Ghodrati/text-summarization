Dean Obeidallah would love an Oscar, but thinks they mostly don't matter in long run.
He says telecast not the draw it once was, and winning doesn't mean bigger box office.
He says for stars win often doesn't mean work; award season makes Oscars anticlimatic.
Obeidallah: Why not give Oscar awards first, then follow with smaller awards later?.
