Zoo in Gaza nearly destroyed during recent Israel-Hamas conflict.
Many of the zoo's animals were killed -- and the survivors are struggling from lack of food and water.
CNN understands the Israeli military believes Hamas may have had rocket launchers in vicinity of zoo.
Hamas says the park is a civilian area, but CNN crew saw metal cases that looked like destroyed rocket batteries.
