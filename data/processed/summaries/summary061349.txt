Blind Horse Knives was created in 2007 by L.T Wright and Dan Coppins.
The business partners were once custom stair builders and made a fair living.
Blind Horse Knives now employs 23 local craftsmen and the product is sold all over the world.
The business name was inspired by Wright's great-great-uncle, who owned a blind horse.
