Iran's Guardian Council has approved just 8 of more than 680 presidential hopefuls.
Hooshang Amirahmadi is a U.S.-based academic who campaigned as a candidate.
He says he was warned his campaign could lead to disorder and his safety was a concern.
Amirahmadi waited until the last day of registration and then withdrew from the race.
