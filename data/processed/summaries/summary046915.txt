U.S. Army opens a virtual-combat gaming center in a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania mall.
State-of-the-art facility is a two-year Army recruiting experiment.
The center includes a Black Hawk helicopter that provides a feel for combat.
Potential recruit: It "helps them recruit people, but it doesn't force them".
