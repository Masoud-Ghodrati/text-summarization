NEW: Netanyahu says he hopes Liberman will prove his innocence.
"I have always operated according to the law," Liberman says.
The final decision on whether to indict Avigdor Liberman will follow a formal hearing.
He is suspected of illegally obtaining about $3 million through shell companies.
The alleged crimes date back to before Liberman became foreign minister.
