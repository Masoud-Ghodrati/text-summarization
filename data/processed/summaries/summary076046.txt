Hundreds protest in al Hamza, an Iraqi town, over a lack of basic services and shortages.
7 are wounded in confrontations with police outside a council building, officials say.
Dozens also demonstrate in the central Iraqi city of Kut, according to officials.
These anti-government protests follow similar ones Sunday and Monday in Baghdad.
