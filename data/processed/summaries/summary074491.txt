NEW: Hasbro has offered to purchase John Spinello's original "Operation" prototype.
Spinello, creator of the game, needs a medical procedure.
Spinello is struggling to pay his bills and doesn't have sufficient health insurance, his friends say.
The game inventor was paid $500 for "Operation" decades ago.
