Former world No. 1 Carlos Moya calls time on his tennis career due to injury problems.
The 34-year-old Spaniard has not played since losing at the Madrid Open in May.
He won 20 titles in 15 years on the ATP Tour, including the 1998 French Open.
Moya was the first player from his country to top the men's world rankings.
