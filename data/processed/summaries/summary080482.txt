Farley's physicalisty good metaphor for book: a meal overstuffed with dish.
Farley doesn't come off as likable -- hookers, drug addiction on full display.
Still, he emerges as more than just a sweaty beast who gave good pratfall.
This unflinching, well-written book outshines any Farley highlight reel.
