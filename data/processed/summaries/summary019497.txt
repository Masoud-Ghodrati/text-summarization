Human Rights Watch demands an end to child soldiers in Syria's civil war.
The monitoring group documents 194 deaths of "non-civilian" male children since 2011.
The report demands the discharge of all soldiers under age 18.
The report, citing logistical and security concerns, did not look into pro-government militias.
