Victor Kovats found with a smashed skull at the foot of a 100-meter (328-foot) cliff in China.
It's thought his parachute failed to deploy after a wingsuit flight, though an investigation is underway.
Kovats was to compete in the second World Wingsuit Championships.
Wingsuit flying sees participants glide through the air wearing a specially constructed suit.
