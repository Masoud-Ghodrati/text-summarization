Conrad Murray's lawyer argues the trial judge erred by denying him bail while appealing conviction.
A jury found Murray guilty of involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death.
Jackson died of an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives under Murray's care.
Murray has about 10 months left to serve unless he is freed early.
