France's president says the hostage rescue operation "did not succeed".
A French soldier dies; one is missing; the hostage is presumed dead, France says.
But Al-Shabaab says the hostage is alive and at a new location.
France says it undertook the rescue bid after the hostage-takers failed to negotiate.
