Paul Rieckhoff: On Tuesday 27 vets of Iraq and Afghanistan will seek seats in Congress.
"New Vet 27" are inspiring; recent vets are often portrayed as villains or victims, he says.
Rieckhoff says they know personally the cost of foreign policy choices.
In 1969, vets held 75 percent of seats in Congress; soon it may be less than a fifth, he writes.
