60 luxury cars sat on the grounds of a French mogul's estate for decades.
Roger Baillon wanted to build a museum for the cars, but his business declined.
A 1961 Ferrari is expected to fetch up to $14.9 million at auction in February.
The auctioneer says it once belonged to actor Alain Delon and that Jane Fonda rode in it.
