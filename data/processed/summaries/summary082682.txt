Lana Kuykendall has had 11 surgeries since being diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis.
While in critical condition, she hasn't had amputations and the disease is all in her leg.
"Lana's vitals and blood work is good," her husband says, according to the hospital.
The father of a Georgia woman with the disease notes milestones in her own fight.
