Panel: Further investigation is needed to pin down who started a clothing factory fire.
112 people, mostly women, died in the fire on the outskirts of Dhaka.
The owner of the factory should be prosecuted for the lack of safety measures, the panel says.
Factory owner Delwar Hossain has said he was not aware of the situation.
