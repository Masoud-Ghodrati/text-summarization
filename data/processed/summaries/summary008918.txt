British politician's opening ceremony tweet sparked a social media backlash.
Aidan Burley, a Conservative Party MP, called the ceremony "multi-cultural crap".
Many online weighed the London ceremony versus the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Social media reaction was largely positive to director Danny Boyle's $42 million production.
