The memristor is a new type of electrical component that could revolutionize electronics.
It was first conceptualized in the 1970s, long before one could even be built.
Researchers at ETH work with IBM in memristors for future computing devices.
Memristor-based chips wouldn't require silicon, so we could see computers in windows, textiles or even coffee cups.
