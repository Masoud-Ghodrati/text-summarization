Tiger Woods tells CNN he plans to play long enough to break Jack Nicklaus' record.
American is four major titles behind the 18 won by Nicklaus, whose last came at 46.
Woods, 36, says he constantly has to answer questions about whether he can win again.
His young rival Rory McIlroy says he aims to match Woods' longevity at the top of golf.
