U.S. horse trainer Michael Matz seeking to win his second Kentucky Derby on Saturday.
Matz worked with Barbaro, who became a star by winning the 132nd edition in 2006.
The colt was put down after shattering his hind leg at the Preakness Stakes that year.
Matz has high hopes for Union Rags in the prestigious race at Churchill Downs.
