Britain's Divina Galica is one of only five women to have entered an F1 grand prix.
Prior to moving into motorsport, Galica was a Winter Olympic skier.
Galica made her F1 bow at the 1976 British GP, but never qualified for a race.
Italy's Lella Lombardi is the only one woman to have scored a Formula One point.
