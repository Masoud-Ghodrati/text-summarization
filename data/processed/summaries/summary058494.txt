Army will test balloons around Washington, D.C. that guard against cruise missiles.
It's a three-year test of the JLENS system and doubles radar capabilities, Army says.
"It's not for surveillance," just for cruise missiles, NORAD spokesman explains.
NORAD also will use the system to track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve.
