Oscar Pistorius was the first double amputee to compete at an able-bodied Olympics.
He described the summer of 2012 as a "dream come true" after Paralympic gold.
The South African had both legs amputated below the knee when he was 11 months old.
He started playing sport at an early age and became a role model for people worldwide.
