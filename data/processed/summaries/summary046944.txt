Alex Ferguson is confident Park Ji-Sung will sign a contract extension at Manchester United.
South Korean midfielder has been at United since 2005, joining from PSV Eindhoven.
Manager Ferguson says Park will agree to a new two-year deal at Old Trafford.
The 30-year-old became the first Asian player to score at three World Cups in 2010.
