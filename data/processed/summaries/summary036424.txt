Gov. Cuomo has ordered an investigation into a bus crash that left 15 dead.
He cited questions about how the bus driver got a commercial driver's license.
Ophadell Williams had served time for manslaughter and grand larceny, an official says.
He claims he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer; he hasn't been charged.
