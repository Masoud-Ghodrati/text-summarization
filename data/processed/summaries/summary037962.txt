Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal says court ruling dismisses "totality" of rape accusation.
A Spanish court "eviscerated" the credibility of young woman model accuser, prince says.
The model, her lawyers and her mom waged "a relentless public attack," prince says.
"Their accusations varied wildly each time," bin Talal says.
