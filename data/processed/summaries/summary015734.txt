Sonar, Highlight and Banjo are a new wave of social apps that were all the buzz at SXSW.
Sonar shows who is chilling at hot spots near you and who you might be interested to meet.
Highlight alerts you when people who share your interests are nearby.
Banjo lets you see whatever content -- tweets, photos, etc. -- nearby users are sharing.
