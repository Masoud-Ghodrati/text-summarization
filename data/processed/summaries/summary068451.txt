Chinese authorities have arrested an obstetrician for allegedly trafficking babies.
The doctor would convince parents to give up their children by saying they were gravely ill.
A baby boy was returned to his parents Monday after being recovered by police.
Police are investigating five similar cases at the same hospital in Shaanxi Province.
