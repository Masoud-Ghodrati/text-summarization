Operators Tokyo Electric Power Company criticized for their handling of the disaster.
Huge volumes of water pumped into the plant to cool the crippled reactors.
But damaged water storage tanks have been leaking irradiated water.
TEPCO said one tank at the Fukushima site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water.
