Indian schoolboy Armaan Jaffer hits a record-breaking 498 in an under-14's tournament.
Jaffer's total is the highest for a schoolboy and included 77 fours from 490 balls faced.
His school teammate Sarfaraz Khan scored 439 to break the record in 2009.
The 13-year-old is the nephew of former India Test batsman Wasim Jaffer.
