Sprinters Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell test positive for banned substances.
Gay last month posted the fastest time in the 100 meters this year at 9.75 seconds.
Powell held the world record in the 100 meters before fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt.
The news comes a month after Veronica Campbell-Brown was provisionally banned.
