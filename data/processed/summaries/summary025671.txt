An Australia ship has left port to try to locate "pings" from missing airliner MH370.
Some see it as the best hope of finding the vanished Malaysia Airlines flight.
It carries state-of-the-art equipment to detect pings from the black boxes.
But man in charge of the gear says it is no use unless search area can be narrowed.
