Femen activists have used topless protest in a campaign against patriarchy.
Journalist Bim Adewunmi says the group's message of equality is good and true.
But she says treating women as "helpless" and "hapless" robs them of agency.
It is not up to Femen to "free" the women of the Middle East and Africa, Adewunmi says.
