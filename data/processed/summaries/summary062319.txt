Katra Sadatganj, Uttar Pradesh, is the Indian village where two cousins were raped and hanged.
Residents blame a cocktail of issues for the attack, which has drawn international headlines.
Poor sanitation, underdevelopment, and apathetic police have all played a part, they say.
Five men, including two police officers, have been arrested in connection with the deaths.
