Rep. Michael Grimm will resign effective Jan. 5, he announced Monday night.
He plead guilty to tax evasion but had resisted calls to resign.
The congressman narrowly won re-election after being hit with a 20-count indictment.
House Speaker John Boehner called Grimm's decision to step down "honorable".
