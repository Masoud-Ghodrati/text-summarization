The plane lands at Taney County airport instead of Branson airport, the airline says.
An airline spokesman says he doesn't yet know why it landed in the wrong place.
The two airports are about seven miles apart and serve the same area.
The landing was uneventful and everyone on board is safe, the spokesman says.
