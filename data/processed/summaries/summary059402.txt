A number of American suspects in high-profile cases have not been brought to justice, say Italians.
In 1998, 20 people were killed when a U.S. Marine Corps jet sliced through steel wires supporting a cable car in the Italian Alps.
In 2009, American troops opened fire at a Baghdad checkpoint, killing Italian secret service agent Nicola Calipari.
The trial of Seattle student Amanda Knox, accused of killing her British roommate Meredith Kercher is also controversial.
