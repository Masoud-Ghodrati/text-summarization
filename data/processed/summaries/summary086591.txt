The plan called for Hinckley to participate in group sessions in Williamsburg, Virginia.
The Virginia facility has withdrawn from the plan for unknown reasons.
Prosecutors say the D.C. hospital treating Hinckley needs to come up with a new plan.
Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of President Reagan.
