Dorothea Lange snapped iconic Great Depression photo of "Migrant Mother" in 1936.
Daughter in photo says it brought shame and determination to her family.
"I wanted to make sure I never lived like that again," Katherine McIntosh says.
McIntosh says her mom, Florence Owens Thompson, was "backbone of our family".
