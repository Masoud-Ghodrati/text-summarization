Zenaida Gonzalez has sued Casey Anthony for defamation.
Anthony told police a nanny by that name had disappeared with her daughter.
The girl was later found dead; Anthony was acquitted of murder in her daughter's death.
A judge points to "disputed" matters in the defamation suit that a jury should decide.
