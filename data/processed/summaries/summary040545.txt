Derreck Kayongo is donating soap to impoverished countries via his Global Soap Project.
The CNN Hero personally delivered the first box of free soap to Kenya last summer.
When he was young, Kayongo found refuge in Kenya after fleeing Uganda.
He says he has seen poor families dance in celebration after receiving soap.
