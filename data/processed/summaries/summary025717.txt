Al-Shabaab is an al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia.
It was once allied with sharia courts, which tried to impose order on the lawless country.
The U.S. government designated it as a foreign terrorist organization in 2008.
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the deadly attack at a Kenyan mall in September of this year.
