Facebook launches Slingshot, a mobile messaging app for photos, videos.
Like Snapchat, it lets users trade messages that disappear after a few seconds.
With Slingshot you can't view an incoming message until you respond with your own.
Slingshot succeeds Poke, a messaging app that Facebook shut down last month.
