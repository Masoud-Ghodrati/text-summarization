Brigitte Bardot says she will request Russian citizenship if two elephants are euthanized.
She has urged President Hollande to save the elephants, thought to have tuberculosis.
Her move comes on the heels of Gerard Depardieu's acceptance of a Russian passport.
Depardieu is angry about French plans to raise taxes on its richest citizens.
