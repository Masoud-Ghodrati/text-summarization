U.N. human rights chief urges probe into alleged deliberate sinking of a packed migrant boat.
If true, he says, "We are looking at what amounts to mass murder in the Mediterranean".
Survivor tells of people smugglers laughing as they rammed the boat, watched it sink.
Children are among as many as 500 people feared dead; 11 survivors have been found.
