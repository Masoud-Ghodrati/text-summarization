Italy's prime minister is accused of sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer.
He dismisses the allegations, saying his opponents have gone too far this time.
The woman in question tells an Italian TV station she never had sex with him.
Italy's top court just struck down a law shielding Berlusconi from prosecution.
