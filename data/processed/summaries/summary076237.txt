Would-be immigrants from Mali and Cameroon rushed en masse to try to illegally enter Spain.
The young men climbed a section of the six-meter-tall, chain-link fence.
About 500 made it in, and they were soon running toward an immigrant holding center in Melilla.
On Wednesday, Madrid sent 120 additional police and civil guards to Melilla.
