Julia Bacha: Why don't we hear the stories of nonviolence from the Israel-Palestinian conflict?.
She says the film Budrus tells of Palestinans uniting wth Israeli's in common cause, nonviolently.
She says they persuaded Israeli army to shift Separation Barrier's course, save Budrus village.
Bacha: People must recognize: Nonviolent protest can be more influential than lethal force.
