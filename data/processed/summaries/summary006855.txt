Dan Simon: Texas may execute Rodney Reed for murder, except he might be innocent.
Simon says the answer to Reed's innocence or guilt hinges on getting DNA testing.
Simon says the state may be afraid of testing because it may learn that it made a mistake.
Texas should take all feasible ways to verify defendant's guilt before execution, he says.
