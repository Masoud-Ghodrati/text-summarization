A joint study assesses U.S. states on corruption, accountability and transparency.
Five states get B grades, 19 get Cs, 18 scored Ds and eight were considered failing.
"State ethics, open records and disclosure laws lack one key feature: teeth," the report says.
New Jersey gets the highest score and Georgia gets the lowest in report.
