A Florida boy drowns in a cruise ship swimming pool, Carnival, police say.
A DJ noticed the boy struggling and stopped the music, a CNN iReporter says.
A guest pulled the boy from the pool, and a crew member tried to revive him, witness says.
Carnival Cruise pools do not have lifeguards, a company spokeswoman says.
