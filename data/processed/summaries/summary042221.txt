Micro-condos -- units under 500 square feet -- are a growing trend in cities like New York, San Francisco and London.
Developers are targeting millenials who wouldn't otherwise be able to afford properties in major Western cities.
The units are designed to be hyper-functional and stylish to appeal to design-conscious young buyers.
