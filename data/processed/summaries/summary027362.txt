Seven athletes from Cameroon have gone missing, their team chief says.
The athletes include five boxers, a woman footballer and a male swimmer, he says.
The athletes have the right to remain in the United Kingdom until early November.
It is not yet clear whether they intend to try to seek asylum in the United Kingdom.
