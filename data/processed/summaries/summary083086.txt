Gen. David Petraeus, who has a Ph.D. from Princeton, wrote the book on counterinsurgency.
Peter Bergen says Petraeus accomplished a huge turnaround in Iraq.
The general took many steps to gain public support for U.S. efforts in Iraq, Bergen says.
He notes Petraeus has said Afghanistan will be harder.
