Paul Sracic says if Occupy Wall Streeters want change, they should run for office.
He says demonstrating in a park won't do anything about corporate power in U.S..
He says protesters want inclusion, consensus, but they have it; it's called democracy.
Sracic: Rallies are fun; running for office not as much. To change U.S., get in game.
