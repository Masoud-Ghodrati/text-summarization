An FBI special agent re-creates the Boston Marathon bombing, ensuing manhunt last week.
Complaint says video shows Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev drop knapsacks near metal barriers.
When the first bomb goes off, most people react with "bewilderment," but not Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
Police say they find clothes in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm resembling those worn by the bomber.
