New Zealand's Sonny Bill Williams is a star in rugby union and rugby league.
Speculation has been heated as to whether he will play for his country in the rugby league World Cup.
His manager says he will chase the dream of winning World Cups in both rugby codes.
He won the rugby union World Cup with New Zealand's All Blacks in 2011.
