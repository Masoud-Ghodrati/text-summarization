NEW: Anglican priest says she thinks the decision is "wonderful news".
Church of England leaders have voted to allow women to become bishops.
It required a two-thirds majority by all three voting bodies -- the bishops, clergy and laity.
The church said the first female bishop could be appointed by the end of the year.
