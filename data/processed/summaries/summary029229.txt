An attempt at the first solar-powered flight around the globe is set for late February.
Stops for Solar Impulse 2 include Myanmar, China, India, Arizona and New York.
Its lithium batteries store enough solar energy for nighttime flight.
Solar Impulse 2's giant wings are wider than a 747-8 Jumbo Jet.
