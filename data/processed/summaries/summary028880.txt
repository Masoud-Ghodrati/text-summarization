Police arrested 46 people Saturday morning in Boston.
"Occupy" protesters have been encamped there since late September.
"Occupy Boston is NOT done! You can't evict an idea! :)," read one Twitter post.
A judge ruled that protesters' First Amendment rights do not extend to seizing and holding areas.
