Scientists strongly believe there is an ocean hidden under the ice surface of Europa.
The Hubble Space Telescope captured a spectrographic image showing water vapor.
Astronomers believe it came from a geyser connected to the hidden ocean.
The vapor could make it possible for a space probe to analyze the water for signs of life.
