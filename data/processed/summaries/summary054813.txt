Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejects a return to the 1967 borders.
President Barack Obama and Netanyahu hold meeting at the White House on Friday.
The pre-1967 borders should be starting point on a future Palestinian state, Obama says.
Netanyahu: A 1967 basis for such borders would leave Israel "indefensible".
