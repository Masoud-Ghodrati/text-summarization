The mosque entrance was set alight, Palestinian official says.
The vandals spray-painted the words "revenge by blood" on the mosque, he said.
The Israel Defense Forces says it was a so-called "price tag" attack.
It was an apparent response to clashes last week between Jewish settlers and Palestinians.
