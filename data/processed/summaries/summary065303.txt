A mother beat her 2-year-old daughter and glued her to the wall over potty training.
The mother, Elizabeth Escalona, pleaded guilty to first degree injury of a child in July.
A pediatrician says at the sentencing hearing "the entire picture was very shocking".
Prosecutors want Escalona sentenced to 45 years in prison, a spokeswoman says.
