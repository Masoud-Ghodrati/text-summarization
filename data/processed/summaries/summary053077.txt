NEW: Crash is "uncannily similar" to one in Spain in July, former rail executive says.
The doomed commuter train was doing 82 mph as it went into a curve, NTSB says.
The throttle was cut and brakes applied "very late in the game," NTSB official says.
Nineteen people remain hospitalized after the crash, which killed four.
