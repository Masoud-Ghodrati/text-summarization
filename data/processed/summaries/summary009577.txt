Talat Hamdani: My son, Mohammad Salman Hamdani, was killed on 9/11.
Hamdani: What I want is a recognition that he died as a first responder.
Given his training and aspirations, he rushed bravely to help those at WTC, she says.
Hamdani: Salman's name should be reflected and listed on the 9/11 Memorial.
