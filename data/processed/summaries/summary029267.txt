Edward Morrissey: Ted Cruz has bright future with GOP, some say he's mulling presidential run.
He says that would be great -- in perhaps 2020; same with young comers Rand Paul, Rubio.
He says there are far more seasoned possible candidates in GOP governor ranks.
Morrissey: Paul, Cruz, Rubio could well be presidents, but should wait till 2020, 2024.
