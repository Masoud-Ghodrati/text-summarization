The world's worst cowards are the members of the Pakistani Taliban, says Frida Ghitis.
They are terrified of Malala Yousufzai, the 14-year-old girl they shot, Ghitis says.
They want to subjugate the local population, particularly women, she says.
Ghitis: They have reawakened Pakistanis to the threat posed by extremists.
