Karen Blixen Cooking School trains young Maasai the art of cooking and fine cuisine.
Students taught to prepare meat and fish, prepare sauces and soups and bake cakes.
"The cuisine that interests me the most is French," says one Maasai student.
The school, part of the Karen Blixen Camp, is funded by the Danish government.
