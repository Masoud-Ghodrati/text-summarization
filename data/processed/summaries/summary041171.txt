Work on Fort Jefferson, 70 miles past Key West, began in 1846.
Because of advances in artillery, the fort became obsolete before it was even finished.
Though never attacked in wars, hurricanes and salt air have taken their toll.
An estimated 100 jobs have been generated by $7 million worth of stimulus funds.
