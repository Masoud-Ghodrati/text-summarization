Nasim says he was a farmer when police arrested him in 2002 and took him to Bagram prison.
He says he is innocent; U.S. records say he was in possession of rocket motors.
He claims he was tortured at the prison: "I was hung from the ceiling for seven days".
Nasim says the Americans and international forces need to get out of Afghanistan.
