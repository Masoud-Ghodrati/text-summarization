Google is barring users of its $1,500 Glass connected eyewear from reselling or loaning them out.
A limited number of developers received beta versions of the Glass headsets this week.
One developer put his Glass headset for sale on eBay, where bidding reached $90,000.
Google says it reserves the right to deactivate the connected device.
