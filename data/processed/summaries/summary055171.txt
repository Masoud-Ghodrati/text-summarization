U.S. defense secretary Chuck Hagel: Iraqi forces are in "full control" of Baghdad.
There's been "some progress" driving back ISIS from Syria's Kobani, Hagel adds.
Officials: "Very bad" now in Anbar province near Baghdad, call for U.S. military's help.
U.S. official: U.S. hasn't gotten a request for ground troops, wouldn't grant it anyway.
