American aid worker Warren Weinstein is being held by al Qaeda.
Alisa Weinstein says she's worried backlash over Bergdahl could hurt her father's case.
She says she wants to know what the U.S. government is doing to bring him home.
"They have shown with this exchange that...if they want to, they can do this," she says.
