Ben Bradlee, 93, has been suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia for several years.
He oversaw Washington Post's coverage of Watergate scandal that led to Nixon's downfall.
Bradlee's wife, columnist Sally Quinn, says she kept his condition private.
He and John F. Kennedy were once neighbors, and Bradlee later wrote books about him.
