15-year-old Pakistani advocate for girls' education rights leaves British hospital.
Taliban gunmen shot Malala Yousufzai in the head and neck on October 9.
She can speak and walk, and will now undergo rehabilitation, doctors say.
After her shooting, the Taliban vowed that if she survived, they would come after her again.
