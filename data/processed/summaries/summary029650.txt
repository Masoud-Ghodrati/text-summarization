Police in the town of Grenchen uncovered the pigs Friday.
"We can't say yet it is a hate crime in those words," police chief says.
An unsigned flier said the act was a "protest against the growing expansion of Islam in Switzerland".
"It is an escalation" in Switzerland, "where Christians and Muslims have all been living together," imam says.
