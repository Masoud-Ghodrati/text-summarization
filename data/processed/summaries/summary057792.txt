Archaeologists have found some 10,000 Roman artifacts in the heart of the City of London.
They include unusual wooden and leather objects, preserved by the wet ground.
A new section of the Temple of Mithras, uncovered at the site in 1954, has also been found.
The excavations are at the site of Bloomberg's new European headquarters.
