NEW: A spokeswoman for Sen. Robert Menendez urges U.S. authorities to investigate.
Menendez has long denied a report that accused him of partying with prostitutes.
Police in the Dominican Republic say the women were paid by a lawyer.
Two of the women received a bit more than $400; the third woman was paid close to $300.
