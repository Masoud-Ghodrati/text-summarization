It now appears the stabbing was not racially motivated, police say.
The suspects, like the victim, were soldiers assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord.
Friends say they were on the way to celebrate Tevin Geike's pending discharge.
Witnesses initially said Geike was attacked after an assailant yelled about soldiers being white.
