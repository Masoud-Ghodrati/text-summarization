Sevan Nisanyan accuses Turkey's government of politically persecuting him.
His crime: "openly denigrating the religious values held by a certain portion of the population.".
He says he has been prosecuted simultaneously in three Turkish courts.
Nisanyan told CNN he recognizes he was deliberately confrontational in court.
