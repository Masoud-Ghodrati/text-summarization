MI6 codebreaker Gareth Williams' body was found locked in a bag in his apartment in 2010.
A coroner's inquest into his death concluded it was likely someone had killed him.
But Scotland Yard says it thinks it's most likely no one else was involved in Williams death.
However, it says there remains insufficient evidence to be definitive on the case.
