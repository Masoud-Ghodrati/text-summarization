Gary L. Stewart says he discovered he was the biological son of the notorious killer.
He was watching television when a 1969 "Wanted" poster flashed on the screen.
His son thought it was Stewart, but he told his son it was his father.
"For the first time in the history of this case ... I have presented more evidence," he says.
