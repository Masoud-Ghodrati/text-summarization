Pirate Mohamed Abdi Hassan, known as "Afweyne," announces retirement.
Piracy began to gain international attention in 2008 as number of attacks grew.
Afweyne got notoriety as organizer of two high-profile hijackings, says Adjoa Anyimadu.
Piracy off coast of Somalia is no longer as lucrative as it once was, says Anyimadu.
