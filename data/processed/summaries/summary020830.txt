New Turkish movie highlights homophobia in the country.
In part the film is based in the slaying of Ahmet Yildiz, which is known as Turkey's first honor killing.
Directors, who were friends with the student, say Turkey has entrenched institutional homophobia.
One of them told CNN minority communities "want to be able to live, first of all, and not be murdered".
