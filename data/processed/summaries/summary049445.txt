Gene Seymour: Jaws wasn't standard, scheming Bond villain. He was no Dr. No or Hugo Drax.
We wanted Bond to beat them. But Jaws more a low-level employee: scary, not hateful, he says.
He says late actor, Richard Kiel, who played Jaws, said he tried to make him more human.
Seymour: His passing makes you realize how singular his villain was; no one else like him.
