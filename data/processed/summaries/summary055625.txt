Pouria Nourmohammadi used a stolen passport to board the airliner, investigators say.
"He boarded the plane with a plan to live in Germany with his mother," his friend says.
Nourmohammadi's mother has shied away from attention.
She says that although her son broke the law, "all 239 persons are the same".
