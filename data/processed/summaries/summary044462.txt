A Michigan woman who took state benefits after a lottery win faces criminal charges.
Amanda Clayton, 25, faces felony counts of welfare fraud.
New legislation signed last week blocks lottery winners from receiving state assistance.
"I thought, maybe it was OK because I'm not working," Clayton said.
