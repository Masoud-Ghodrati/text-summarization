President Hassan Rouhani has presented Iran's parliament with a proposed cabinet list.
Ali Reza Eshraghi says it suggests a return to the old guard, after Ahmadinejad.
16 proposed ministers had positions in the government of reformist Mohammad Khatami.
However, three key posts were not given to pure reformists, Eshraghi says.
