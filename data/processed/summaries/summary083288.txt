Center in Pakistan tries to rehabilitate children ready to be suicide bombers.
The center works more as a child protection unit than a counterterror unit.
Families say Taliban targets poor parents and at-risk children with promises of help.
At least one child now at the center was sent on a suicide mission by the Taliban.
