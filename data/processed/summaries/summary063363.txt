Complaints have been filed alleging that Bassem Youssef insulted Islam, Egypt's president.
The popular Egyptian television host is released on bond after questioning by prosecutors.
Youssef is a satirist whom some compare to Jon Stewart for his irreverent take on politics.
While he was questioned, he mocked officials in a string of Twitter posts.
