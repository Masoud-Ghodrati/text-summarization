Adam Lanza fired roughly one bullet every two seconds, a local prosecutor says.
He brought 10 30-round capacity magazines for a semiautomatic rifle into the school.
More than 1,600 rounds of ammunition were found in the house where he killed his mother.
Lanza fatally shot 20 children and six teachers at a Connecticut school before killing himself.
