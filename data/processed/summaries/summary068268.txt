Conservative writer Crystal Wright is outraged by her party's embrace of racist rancher Bundy.
Her followers on Twitter have tried to make excuses for Bundy's comments.
Some conservatives initially applauded Bundy's stand against the federal government.
Wright: "The real insult is Bundy never should have been embraced in the first place".
