4 Americans, including its ambassador to Libya, died in a 2012 attack on a mission.
Obama has said that Ahmed Abu Khatallah was "one of the masterminds" of the attack.
Abu Khatallah was nabbed by U.S. commandos, FBI agents this month in Libya.
He's expected to be prosecuted in a federal court in Washington.
