Savita Halappanavar, who was 17 weeks pregnant, went into a hospital complaining of back pain.
Doctors said she was having a miscarriage that would end in a matter of hours, report says.
Halappanavar's husband sought an abortion to end the pain, but doctors refused, citing law.
Her death led to protests, and top Irish lawmakers are discussing a change to the law.
