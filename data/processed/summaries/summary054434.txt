Sen. Rand Paul: I support Mitt Romney but question some of his foreign policy speech.
He says Romney seeks more intervention in Mideast, where U.S. wars have fared poorly.
Paul says arming the rebels in Syria risks empowering some people with anti-U.S. agendas.
He says U.S. defense budget is too high, growing at unsustainable rate.
