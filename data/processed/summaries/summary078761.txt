The ATF's Operation Fast and Furious lost track of hundreds of weapons in Mexico.
Two of the missing weapons were found at the scene of a border patrol agent's death.
ATF Deputy Director Hoover was among officials criticized by a congressional report.
Hoover officially submitted his retirement papers this week.
