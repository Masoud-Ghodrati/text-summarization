Cristiano Ronaldo has been named in Portugal's squad for their World Cup play-off clash with Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Portugal coach Carlos Queiroz has selected the forward despite the objections of Real Madrid over Ronaldo's injury problems.
Real coach Manuel Pellegrini had said it would be "impossible for Ronaldo to play with Portugal" in the match.
