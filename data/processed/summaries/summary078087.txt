Justin Va誰sse: French president Francois Hollande avoided making big promises.
France's debt is near 90% of GDP, and the 2011 deficit was 5.2%, says Va誰sse.
Hollande has to be fiscally responsible yet restore France's competitiveness, Va誰sse says.
Va誰sse: Europe must find a way to stimulate the economy without deepening the deficit.
