A new play about Anne Frank features stunningly realistic sets.
The play is staged in a purpose-built theater on the outskirts of Amsterdam.
Audiences have been moved to tears, and standing ovations.
The play is presented in Dutch, but subtitles or audio translations are scheduled to be introduced in July.
