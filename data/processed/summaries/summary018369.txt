Jared Lee Loughner no longer has to take anti-psychotic medication, a court says.
The defendant has also been diagnosed as schizophrenic, prosecutors say.
Loughner's attorneys say forcing him to take strong drugs violates his rights.
Loughner is accused of shooting U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and several others.
