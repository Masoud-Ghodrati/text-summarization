Lawyer Mark Lewis says he is about to take action in the U.S. on behalf of 3 clients.
One of those clients is a U.S. citizen, he says.
Lewis represents dozens of people in the UK who say their phones were hacked by Murdoch papers.
The phone hacking scandal led to the closure of the UK's News of the World newspaper.
