Holyfield teams up with Canadian philanthropist Yank Barry to help Syrian refugees.
The pair visited a camp near Bulgaria's border with Turkey to rehouse some families.
They met Syrian refugees demanding to know why more isn't being done to help.
Bulgaria is building a wall along part of the border with Turkey, to keep refugees out.
