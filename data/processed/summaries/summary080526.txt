The L.A. Fire Department releases a 911 tape involving actress Demi Moore.
A woman requests an ambulance, saying Moore was "convulsing" and "burning up".
Another said Moore reacted after she "smoked something ... similar to incense".
Sarah Jessica Parker will take over Moore's role as Gloria Steinem in "Lovelace".
