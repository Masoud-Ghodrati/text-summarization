The flare on a North Sea platform that has been leaking gas has gone out, Total says.
There had been fears the flare could ignite the clouds of escaping gas.
Gas has been leaking from the platform off the Scottish coast since Sunday.
Total is starting work on a plan to stop the leak, including drilling relief wells.
