Dr. David Scheiner says president's health care plan doesn't go far enough.
He's worried that "private insurers continue to be a part of the health scheme".
He'd rather see the U.S. have a single-payer system like those in Canada, Europe.
He says he was supposed to speak at Obama town hall but was dropped from it.
