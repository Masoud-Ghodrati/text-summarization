NEW: NFL player Donte Stallworth could be playing again in "weeks," his agent says.
A hot air balloon went down after hitting power lines in Miami, sending 2 to the hospital.
Stallworth, who suffered severe burns, was in the balloon with a female friend, his lawyer says.
The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
