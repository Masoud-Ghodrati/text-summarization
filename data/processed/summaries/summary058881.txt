Omar Shaban was born to a Palestinian refugee family and grew up in Gaza.
In 1987 he participated in the first intifada and went on to work for as a peace campaigner.
But he says as violence has increased, so has the gap between citizens on both sides.
He says it is disheartening to see that Gaza is further from peace than it was 20 years ago.
