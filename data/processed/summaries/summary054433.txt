United Flight 831 took off around 9 a.m. from Dulles airport, the airline's website says.
Its crew noticed a strong odor in the plane, says FAA and United spokesmen.
As a result, the flight is diverted and lands at Havana airport around noon.
United, which doesn't fly to Cuba, is sending a plane there to transport passengers.
