NEW: Next November, California voters will consider taxes raising $7 billion in revenue.
The almost $1 billion in cuts will hurt universities, schools, the elderly and the disabled.
The cuts are less than an earlier estimate of up to $2.4 billion, the governor says.
California earlier this year slashed spending by $16 billion to deal with deficit.
