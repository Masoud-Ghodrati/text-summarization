Alberto Cutie married Ruhama Canellis on Tuesday, court documents show.
Cutie was Catholic priest seen in tabloid photos embracing woman in bathing suit.
After pictures surfaced, Cutie admitted two-year relationship with the woman.
He said last month he was leaving Catholic Church and becoming Episcopalian.
