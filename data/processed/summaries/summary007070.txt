Rep. Adam Schiff: Iran's nuclear program has been a top national security concern for 10 years.
Schiff:  Escalating sanctions were meant to force Iran into a deal, and Iran is at the table.
He says another round of sanctions could derail negotiations and is unnecessary.
Schiff: We must seize this chance; if it fails, there would be no doubt we tried diplomatically.
