NASA releases a photo taken last week from the Curiosity rover on Mars.
It shows a speck NASA says is the rover's first image of Earth from the red planet.
Earth, its moon would be "two distinct, bright 'evening stars'" to observers on Mars, NASA says.
Curiosity launched from Florida in fall 2011, landing on Mars the next August to study that planet.
