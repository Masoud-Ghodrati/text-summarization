Defense and prosecution have rested their cases in the trial of Brian David Mitchell.
Jury will decide if Mitchell's mental problems kept him from knowing right from wrong.
Defense said Mitchell is so delusional that he could not understand his actions.
Prosecutors produced mental health experts who said Mitchell knew his actions were wrong.
