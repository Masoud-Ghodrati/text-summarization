Hamish Hamilton has directed Super Bowl halftime shows, Oscars, Olympic ceremonies.
He says technology is crucial but can distract from performances.
Last year's Super Bowl blackout was not caused by halftime show, Hamilton says.
He says the extreme weather possibility this year is a concern but also "exciting".
