50 people plan to sail to Gaza to protest Israel's blockage of the Palestinian area.
Last year, 9 were killed after Israeli forces confronted a similar flotilla.
Sec. of State Clinton calls the plan not "useful," urges Americans not to take part.
An activist say the U.S. is giving Israel the "green light" to attack the flotilla.
