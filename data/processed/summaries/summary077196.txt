A government report finds that Monica Lewinsky was mistreated during the 1998 affair investigation.
Lewinsky, who had an affair with President Bill Clinton starting in 1995, was hounded by agents to cooperate in the investigation.
In doing so, the agents did not allow Lewinsky to contact her lawyer and confronted her with a "false affidavit".
The release of the report comes at a time when Lewinsky is stepping back into public after a decade of attempted privacy.
