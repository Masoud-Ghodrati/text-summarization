Ukraine crisis is making Europeans think again about '30s and origins of World War II, says Timothy Snyder.
Snyder: As with Putin today in Ukraine, Hitler in 1938 in Austria based claim on need to protect fellow ethnics.
Once Austria had gone, European leaders easily betrayed Czechoslovakia, which truly deserved support, he adds.
Seizure of Crimea was meant as challenge to EU, to prove European values cannot defend themselves - Snyder.
