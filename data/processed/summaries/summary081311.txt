The battle between the government and separatists for eastern Ukraine is taking its toll on the area's residents.
Ukraine's President has cut off social services in "occupied" areas, and many in Donetsk are starving.
There are no banks left open in the city; residents in the city line up for food handouts driven in from beyond the city.
Donetsk's residents resent Ukraine's Kiev-based government, but deplore the rebels' inability to help them.
