The Slurpee, orginally called an ICEE, was created by accident in the 1950s.
7-Eleven licensed a Slurpee machine in 1965 and renamed it at that time.
For "The Simpson's" Movie in 2007, 7-Elevens were converted to look like Kwik-E-Marts.
41 percent of slurpers never mix their flavors and 37 percent always do.
