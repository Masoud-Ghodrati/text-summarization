The "Zombie" virus is transmitted from cell phone to cell phone.
The virus binds with a security ap, which transmits SIM card data to a central server.
Hackers at other end send back virus-ridden links for games and software, CCTV says.
Nearly 1 million phones in China were infected in the first week of September, official says.
