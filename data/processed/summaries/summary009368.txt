Amitai Etzioni: President Obama should set one clear  position on treatment of terrorists.
Etzioni: Terrorists can't be treated as criminals; prevention, not prosecution, needed.
They aren't soldiers, he says, since uniforms set troops apart from civilians, show nationality.
Terrorists deserve rights but aren't entitled to face their accusers, Etzioni says.
