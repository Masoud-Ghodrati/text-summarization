In China, cosmetics now outstrips groceries as the biggest selling item in its department stores.
In 2013, Chinese women, and increasingly men, spent 162.5 billion yuan ($26 billion) on cosmetics.
Japan's annual beauty and personal care market is still the largest in the region at about $50bn.
But China's 150 million-strong middle class is closing the gap fast and its focus is increasingly South Korea.
