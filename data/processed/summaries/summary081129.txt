Football giant FC Barcelona is supporting a project to distribute 1 million e-books in Africa.
The project will see e-readers given to children in Ghana, Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda.
It is believed the devices encourage literacy by providing students access to more titles.
Younger students in an e-reader pilot project in Ghana performed better in reading tests.
