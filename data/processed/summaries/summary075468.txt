Formula One team Toro Rosso give teenage driver Jaime Alguersuari a contract for 2010.
The 19-year-old will line up alongside Sebastian Buemi for Red Bull's feeder team.
He became F1's youngest driver when he replaced Sebastien Bourdais in Hungary.
Spaniard finished only three of his eight races at the wheel in 2009.
