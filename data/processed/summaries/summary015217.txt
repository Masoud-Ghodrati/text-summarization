Spc. William Colton Millay faces several charges, including communicating military info.
He believed he was giving info to "a foreign intelligence agent," the military says.
His friends have expressed shock at the claims, with one saying he's "the wrong guy".
The 22-year-old Kentucky native enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2007.
