Wood's cause of death is now listed as "drowning and other undetermined factors".
The 1981 death certificate concluded that the actress died from "accidental drowning".
Reopened last November, the case is still an active investigation, detective says.
Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981.
