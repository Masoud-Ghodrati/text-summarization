Women have dramatically different reactions about Huma Abedin's decision.
Some think Abedin is doing the right thing, others think she is making a bad mistake.
One feminist argued that women should be focusing on Weiner, not Abedin.
Women also debate the impact of Abedin's background as a top Clinton adviser.
