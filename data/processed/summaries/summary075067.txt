Alex Honnold became fascinated with mountain climbing at 10 years old.
Honnold travels the country and world, climbing with and without a tether.
Peter Mortimer filmed Honnold's climbs for the documentary "Alone on the Wall".
"Alex is inarguably the greatest in the history of the sport," says Mortimer.
