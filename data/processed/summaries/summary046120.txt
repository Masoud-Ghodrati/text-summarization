LAPD responded to a call that "a male white and female black were involved in a sexual act".
"Two people were briefly detained, but it was revealed no crime had been committed," LAPD says.
Daniele Watts is African-American and her boyfriend is white.
Watts says LAPD officers handcuffed her, but not her boyfriend, Cheffy Be*Live.
