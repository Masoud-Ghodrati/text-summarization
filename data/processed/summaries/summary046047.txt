Joan Smalls, 22, has risen from catalog model to one of fashion's most-sought-after beauties.
She's walked for Jason Wu, Donna Karan and Tory Burch during New York Fashion Week.
She is the first Latina to sign on as the face of Estee Lauder's global marketing campaign.
"Beauty is diverse, and you don't have to be a certain stereotype to be beautiful," she says.
