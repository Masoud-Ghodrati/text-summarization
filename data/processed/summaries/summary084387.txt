Manchester City have announced a 10-year naming rights agreement with Etihad Airways.
The deal means the City of Manchester Stadium is now known as the Etihad Stadium.
The Abu-Dhabi based airline has also extended shirt sponsorship agreement.
Last season was City's most successful campaign since the mid-1970s.
