When Chip Paillex's garden amassed excess produce in 2002, he donated the extras.
He soon began a nonprofit, harvesting crops for the Garden State's less fortunate.
By 2007, he left his corporate job to dedicate himself full time to America's Grow-a-Row.
It has since grown to 49 acres of farmland and nearly 4,000 volunteers.
