Frida Ghitis: Syria's regime has issued an unprecedented threat to use chemical weapons.
Previously, Syria had always denied it owned any chemical or biological weapons, she says.
The U.S. has focused on diplomatic approaches to dealing with Syria, says Ghitis.
Ghitis: The U.S. and its allies should push to help Syrians remove al-Assad from power.
