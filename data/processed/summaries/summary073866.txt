Teacher Erica Nigrelli passed out in a classroom; teachers did CPR, used a defibrillator.
Nigrelli's heart had stopped, and doctors delivered her baby by C-section.
Doctors then revived Nigrelli; later she learned she had a heart condition.
Today, baby and mother are well; couple credits quick-acting teachers.
