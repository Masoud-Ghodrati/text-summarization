Ilya Shapiro says that political speech should not be regulated by states.
The U.S. Supreme Court will rule on an Ohio case that outlaws political lies.
Shapiro: Idea that a censor would vet speeches, ads against Truth-o-meter is a joke.
Ohio's ban of lies and damn lies, he argues, is inconsistent with the First Amendment.
