Fernando Meirelles says the Rio Games will be an opportunity to show Brazil's energetic potential.
He says the center of attention should be Brazil's natural resources and the importance they have for the world.
Brazil's rainforest is increasingly critical to the fragile balance of the planet's climate, says Meirelles.
Meirelles: "It could be the Olympics of the future -- a real planetary event.".
