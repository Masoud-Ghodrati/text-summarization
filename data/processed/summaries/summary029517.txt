A clay cylinder found under the walls of Babylon is a key link to our past.
Neil MacGregor says the Cyrus Cylinder describes rare act of tolerance.
It tells the story of Persian King Cyrus, who allowed conquered people to return home.
MacGregor: Cyrus Cylinder will tour five major U.S. museums starting in March.
