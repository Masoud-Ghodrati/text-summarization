NSA leaker Edward Snowden accused NZ PM John Key of misleading public over spying.
He was speaking at an event organized by Kim Dotcom billed as the election's "moment of truth".
Dotcom is battling extradition on U.S. copyright charges and has formed a political party.
Dotcom was the subject of unlawful surveillance by a NZ intelligence agency.
