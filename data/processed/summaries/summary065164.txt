Five other construction workers based in Elizabeth, New Jersey, will share the jackpot.
A court rules that Lopes had fraudulently claimed the entire bounty.
The $38.5 million ticket amounted to $24 million after Lopes chose the cash option.
They are expected to be awarded about $2 million each, after taxes and attorneys' fees.
