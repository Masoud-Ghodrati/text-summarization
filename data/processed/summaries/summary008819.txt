Rock the Vote recently launched a campaign to push back against voting restrictions.
Eric Liu: Republicans who restrict voting may win now, but party suffers long term.
He says a confident party doesn't work in a cynical way to shrink the electorate.
Liu: The next America is waiting to be made, GOP should embrace all people.
