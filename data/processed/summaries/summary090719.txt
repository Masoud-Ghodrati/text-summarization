NEW: A Somali man is sentenced to 30 years in prison in high-seas piracy attempt.
Jama Idle Ibrahim is one of a group of would-be pirates who were captured.
He has admitted to trying to seize a U.S. merchant vessel and hold it for ransom.
Until this year, the last piracy-related conviction in the United States was in 1861.
