More than 1,200 NASA workers were laid off Friday because of the shuttle program's end.
The layoffs went ahead despite Congress' approval of NASA's $19 billion budget.
Many NASA workers, like John Bundy, haven't updated their résumé in decades.
Bundy, whose last day was Friday, is taking welding classes at a community college.
