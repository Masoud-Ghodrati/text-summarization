Fans using the word "yid" at Sunday's game between Spurs and West Ham face arrest.
Some fans brand themselves the "Yid Army," though the term can be offensive.
The Football Association had warned fans they face prosecution for uttering "yid".
A West Ham supporter was banned last season for his Nazi salute at the same fixture.
