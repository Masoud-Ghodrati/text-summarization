Tropical Storm Washi hit the Philippines in December, killing more than 1,000 people.
Areas near Cagayan de Oro and Iligan City are still rebuilding from the storm.
Vince Avena and friends collected supplies to distribute to those affected by the storm.
Avena named the trip Operation VALENTINES and hopes it brings the victims joy and happiness.
