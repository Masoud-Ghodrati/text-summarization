The body of one of the train drivers has been removed from his crushed cab, police say.
The head-on collision of two commuter trains in western Switzerland happened Monday.
Authorities say the train driver who survived may have left the station too soon.
The trains were on a route between Payerne and Lausanne, an official says.
