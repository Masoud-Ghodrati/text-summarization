Eight-second video shows President walking in braces with the help of an aide.
The footage is one of two known extended clips in existence showing him walking.
Former MLB pitcher James "Jimmie" DeShong shot the film on a home movie camera.
Filmmaker Ken Burns says film "clearly shows what a brave struggle it was for FDR to move".
