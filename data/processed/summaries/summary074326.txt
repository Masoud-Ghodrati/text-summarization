The day after Summer Olympics end is expected to be the busiest in Heathrow's history.
The airport estimates it will check through 10,000 athletes on that one day.
To ease the crush, it plans a temporary terminal just for departures.
Heathrow will also allow athletes to check their luggage at Olympic Village on that day.
