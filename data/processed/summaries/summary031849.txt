Officials say Flight 370 was diverted, but how likely is it that terrorists were responsible?.
Peter Bergen says known terrorist groups seem unlikely to be involved.
Jemaah Islamiyah has a presence in Malaysia, but it has been on the decline, he says.
Bergen: If a terrorist group was responsible, it hasn't acted to achieve any political aims.
