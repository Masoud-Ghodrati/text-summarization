Jean Carper says by 2050 13.5 million in U.S. projected to have Alzheimer's.
She says research shows most Alzheimer's can be held off a few years with lifestyle choices.
Education, eating right, exercise, being conscientious and easy-going can help, she says.
Carper: Delaying Alzheimer's by 5 years would spare 6 million people by 2050.
