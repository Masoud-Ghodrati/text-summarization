Jay Parini: Easter is Christians' most powerful day. People vary on how literal resurrection is.
The Gospel writings about this are unclear on what happened. They skip that part, he says.
He says in post-Resurrection accounts Jesus appears, but he is not recognizable.
Parini: Differing accounts suggest much was rumor. But Easter rebirth message endures.
