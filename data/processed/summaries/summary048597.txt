Apple and Danish company ReSound have teamed up on a new hearing aid.
The technology pairs with the latest iPhone, iPad and iPod touch.
Wearers can stream stereo audio from their mobile devices directly to their ears.
Doctors and manufacturers hope Apple's integration will do away with hearing aid stigmas.
