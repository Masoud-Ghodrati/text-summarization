A long-time friend of Vaclav Havel's remembers him as fearless against the regime.
Havel loved wine and company and could bring people together, Paul Wilson recalls.
He believed that if you have ideas for change, you must help bring that change about.
He continues to inspire activists in China, Cuba and now the Arab world.
