Many say bombing suspect's trial should be in federal court due to death penalty.
Former prosecutor David Frakt says that's a poor basis for a decision on where to try him.
He says the case seems more focused on state matters, belongs in Mass. court.
Frakt: Don't treat Tsarnaev as "enemy combatant"; don't deny him civil liberties.
