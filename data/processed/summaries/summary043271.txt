Duncan Shropshire takes daughter Mia-Grave to see where ancestors are buried.
The family grave dates to the 1800s, Shropshire says.
Gravemarkers used in black burial sites include iron pipes, broken dishes, trees.
People were buried in different parts of the cemetery based on skin color, Shropshire explains.
