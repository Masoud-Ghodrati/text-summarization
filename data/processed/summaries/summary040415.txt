Spain has seen hundreds of protests since the "Indignados" movement erupted.
In 2011, activists took over Madrid's Puerta del Sol, inspiring the global "Occupy" campaign.
Two years on, many are still angry, and marches and sit-ins are common in the capital.
A mass demonstration is planned in towns and cities across Spain on February 23.
