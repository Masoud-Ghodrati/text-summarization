William Howell says front-runner Rick Perry was target for GOP candidates at debate.
He says Mitt Romney turned focus to Social Security and Perry's Ponzi scheme comment.
He says Perry now says he'd keep Social Security safe, then talks about moving it to states.
Howell: Perry may be favored, but in general election Social Security stance would hurt him.
