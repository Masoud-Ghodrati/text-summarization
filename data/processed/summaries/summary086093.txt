Former Sgt. Kyle White and comrades were ambushed in 2007 in Afghanistan.
White's only cover during ferocious assault was a single tree on a mountain.
He braved enemy fire to try and save two men, and helped a third who was rescued.
White was also injured twice during the battle, but refused help until others were attended to.
