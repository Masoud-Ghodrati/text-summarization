San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's lawyer writes to city attorney about city paying legal fees.
He says Filner never got sexual harassment training as mayor, congressman.
Filner is being sued by a former spokeswoman for sexual harassment.
The mayor's lawyer says the city would be liable if the ex-spokeswoman wins.
