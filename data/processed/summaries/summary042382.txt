Zahir Belounis says Qatar deserves to host the World Cup in 2022.
Belounis was stuck in Qatar for two years over a pay dispute but returned to France this week.
He says the people in Qatar are "working very hard" to stage the tournament.
Belounis suspects that his playing career is over as his "psychology is very bad".
