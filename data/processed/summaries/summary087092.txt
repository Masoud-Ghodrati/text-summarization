A report by U.N. Special Rapporteur Ben Emmerson QC cites civilian drones casualties.
Clare Algar says the report shows the "devastating impact of drones on innocent people".
She says Gen. McChrystal has warned the strikes can create tremendous resentment.
People should demand to know how the secret drone campaign makes them safer, Algar says.
