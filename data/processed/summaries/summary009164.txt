The game is a follow-up to the original "Kid Icarus" title that came out 25 years ago.
A device called the Fiend's Caldron allows players to spend hearts to adjust the difficulty.
Some weapons can be fused with other weapons to create even more powerful attacks.
"Kid Icarus: Uprising" is available now and only for the Nintendo 3DS.
