NEW: An analyst says another story suggests Kim Jong Il's son is a fan of Clapton.
A performance by the rock icon was called "an opportunity to build good will".
The suggestion was relayed to the U.S. embassy in South Korea via an intermediary.
The cable is one of thousands being released by the WikiLeaks website.
