Nearly 92% of Congress -- or 491 of the 535 members -- identifies as Christian, according to a study by Pew Research.
Of the 301 Republicans in the 114th Congress, Jewish freshman Rep. Lee Zeldin of New York is the only non-Christian.
Democrats in Congress are 12% Jewish and have two Buddhist, two Muslims, one Hindu and one unaffiliated member.
Though 20% of the country does not identify with a faith, only one member of Congress publicly identifies as such.
