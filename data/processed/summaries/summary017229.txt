Frenchman Thierry Le Portier has been training big cats for the past 49 years.
Three of his tigers were used as references for the Oscar-nominated film "Life of Pi".
Le Portier says training is "an art" that takes time and an understanding of the animals.
He says the only animals that scare him are those that have been made "exotic pets".
