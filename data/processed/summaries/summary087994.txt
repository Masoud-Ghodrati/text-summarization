Lebanese activists have started a movement to change racist attitudes in the country.
Migrant workers and Lebanese of different backgrounds are treated poorly, they say.
The group has carried out stings at beach resorts exposing racist attitudes by owners.
They say the deeply entrenched problem can only be overcome by changing individual mindsets.
