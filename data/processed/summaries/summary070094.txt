A car accident in 1994 left drummer Jason Gerling a quadriplegic.
Gerling used a set-up that required him to hit a pad to trigger the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal, normally controlled by the feet.
That took away from his drumming, so he invented a way to trigger the bass and hi-hat using a mouthpiece.
He debuted his invention at an April concert in Minneapolis.
