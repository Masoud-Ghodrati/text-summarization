NEW: The spacecraft docks at 10:28 p.m. ET after flight of less than six hours.
Up until now, it would take two days for crews to go from Earth to the space station.
The spacecraft orbited Earth four times before docking, compared to the usual 16 orbits.
Its three-member crew will remain on the space station through September.
