Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is refusing to concede in the presidential election.
He says he is filing a legal challenge because of allegations of vote-rigging.
Election officials: Enrique Pena Nieto won 38.21% of the votes, to Lopez Obrador's 31.59%.
The results remain unofficial until the country's electoral tribunal ratifies them.
