A company called Pavegen has developed a technology to turn footsteps into electricity.
Walking and other human activities can generate power via piezoelectric cells.
Pavegen's energy harvesting technology can produce up to 7 watts of electricity with each footstep.
Analysts estimate the energy harvesting industry could be worth as much $30 billion by 2018.
