Steven Sanderson of Wildlife Conservation Society says tiger population has plummeted.
A summit in Russia with conservationists, nation leaders could set tiger's fate, he says.
Society has proposed an $82 million plan at summit to stop decline, boost recovery, he says.
Sanderson: Plan still short of financial target; leaders must not fail as stewards of planet.
