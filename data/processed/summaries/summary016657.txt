A campaign calls on Saudi women to defy the country's de facto driving ban on Saturday.
The Interior Ministry warns Saudi laws prohibit "activities disturbing the public peace".
A campaign supporter says the statement is not aimed at women planning to drive.
Instead, she says, it is a warning to others planning to stage protests of their own.
