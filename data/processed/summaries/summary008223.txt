The head of aerospace firm Avio says a new model is needed for European growth.
Europe must innovate to avoid being "squeezed" by the muscle of China and the U.S..
Avio is the prime contractor for the Vega rocket system, first launched in February.
The system is for small satellites, which Avio believes will drive the aerospace market.
