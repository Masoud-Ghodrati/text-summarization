Blake Hounshell: Obama got bin Laden but hasn't brought stability to Afghanistan.
Enter Mitt Romney, he says, who denounces Obama but whose positions are all over the place.
He says Romney would do about same as Obama; Afghanistan is an intractable conflict.
Hounshell: U.S. will leave Afghanistan under Romney or Obama; not easy, but necessary.
