Voters re-elect President Anibal Cavaco Silva to another five-year term.
He gets 53% of the vote, enough support to avoid a runoff election.
Silva will continue to team with Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates.
Portugal is facing an economic crisis that has prompted fears it will need a bailout.
