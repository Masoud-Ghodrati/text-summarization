U.S. intelligence: Three Russian warships in the Mediterranean may have weapons for Syria.
The ships are believed to be carrying parts of an air defense missile system.
Such a system would make striking targets in Syria more difficult, U.S. believes.
U.S. aircraft carrier, a Patriot missile battery and F-16s will be in the Mideast this month.
