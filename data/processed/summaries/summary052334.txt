House Speaker John Boehner says the U.S. needs to finish the job right in Afghanistan.
The progress, he says, has been significant, but the country will continue to have setbacks.
He argues that there is a shared, bipartisan legacy in Washington for Afghanistan.
Boehner: History will judge us not on whether we ended wars, but how we ended them.
