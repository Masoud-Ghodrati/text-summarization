Nyiramasuhuko is the only woman to be convicted by the U.N.-backed court for Rwanda.
She was minister for family and women's affairs at the time of the mass killings.
Five other officials, including her son, are guilty of genocide and other charges.
Some 800,000 people, mainly ethnic Tutsis, died in the violence.
