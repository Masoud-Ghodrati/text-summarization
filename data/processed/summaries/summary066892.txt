Former Spain coach Javier Clemente will take charge of Cameroon's national team.
The 60-year-old will replace Paul Le Guen when he signs a two-year contract next week.
Cameroon lost all three matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Clemente returns to management after short stint at relegated Real Valladolid.
