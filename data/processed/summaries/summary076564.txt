Authorities: Ron Lee Haskell's mother had a restraining order against him.
This came after he allegedly "physically restrained" her following an argument.
A week later, police say Haskell fatally shot 6 of his estranged wife's kin, including 4 children.
He collapses in court, reportedly as the capital murder charges against him are read aloud.
