Apple upgraded its iPod Nano with a video camera, not its iPod Touch.
Nano's video camera is a direct challenge to Flip's tiny, no-zoom camcorder.
Nano has an FM radio with live pausing, rewinding and ability to tag tracks in iTunes.
Perhaps Apple is putting the Touch on a two-year update plan like the iPhone.
