Adam Lanza's mother bought a semiautomatic Bushmaster rifle at Riverview Gun Sales.
Lanza used that gun to kill 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
The Connecticut gun store lost its license to sell guns six days after that mass shooting.
A detective suspects gun sales at the store were stopped due to poor record keeping.
