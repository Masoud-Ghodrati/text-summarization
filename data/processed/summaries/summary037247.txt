Songezo Jim is the first black South African to compete in a World Tour cycling event.
The 22-year-old took up sport aged 14 after his parents died but didn't know how to ride.
As part of MTN-Qhubeka team, Jim participated in last month's Milan-San Remo race.
He wants to improve so that he can take part in the Tour de France in 2015.
