NEW: Russian authorities decide to move Nadezhda Tolokonnikova to a different prison.
Her husband earlier said she had resumed a hunger strike in protest at conditions.
She was hospitalized after going on hunger strike for several days last month.
She was sentenced to two years in prison for her role in a Pussy Riot protest performance.
