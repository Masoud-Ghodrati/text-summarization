Srey Powers, a former Khmer refugee, was adopted from Cambodia at the age of six.
She was left in an orphanage without explanation of what was happening to her.
Twelve years later she traveled with her adoptive mother to find her Cambodian family.
She found her grandmother, who said: "Forgive me for giving you away".
