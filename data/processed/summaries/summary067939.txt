Marion "Suge" Knight was arrested late Friday at a suburban L.A. shopping mall.
Police say he was detained after failing to appear in court on a traffic violation.
Knight was arrested, booked and issued a citation, a process that took an hour.
The co-founder of Death Row Records has had several run-ins with the law.
