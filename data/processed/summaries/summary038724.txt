China has evacuated more than 3,000 citizens from Vietnam, Xinhua reports.
Anti-Chinese protests in Vietnam descended into deadly violence last week.
The unrest was provoked by Chinese oil drilling in disputed waters.
Vietnamese authorities have arrested hundreds and are calling for protests to stop.
