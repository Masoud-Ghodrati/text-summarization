Photos show Oscar Pistorius and Reeva Steenkamp together not long before her death.
One shows Steenkamp hanging over his shoulders, as he tenderly holds her fingers.
Another shows her nestling into his shoulder as he holds her in his arms.
Pistorius goes on trial for Steenkamp's slaying next month; he says he shot her by mistake.
