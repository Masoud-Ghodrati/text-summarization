Protests have followed disputed presidential election results in Iran.
President Ahmadinejad is popular across Iran's rural areas, among Basij militia.
Protesters say not out to challenge the Islamic regime, just want fresh vote.
Iran previously saw protests, public calls for reform in 1999 and 2000.
