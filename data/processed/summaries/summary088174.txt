Abhisit Vejjajiva and his former deputy are charged over the death of a taxi driver.
The driver was killed amid a crackdown on protests in Bangkok in 2010.
A court ruled last month that his death resulted from military acts ordered by Abhisit.
More than 90 people were killed in the 2010 clashes in Bangkok.
