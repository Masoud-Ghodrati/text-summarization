Newburgh, New York, is being considered as a potential site for 9/11 trial.
"We've got nothing to lose," says Mayor Nick Valentine.
County official: "I don't want to be known as the terrorist capital of the world".
Newburgh made headlines last summer after authorities say they foiled a terror plot.
