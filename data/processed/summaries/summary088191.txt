Seun Kuti says previous fuel subsidy reductions have not resulted in better infrastructure.
The removal of subsidies, says Kuti, is in line with IMF policy but harms Nigerians.
He argues that the people do not trust the government to honor their promises.
Kuti thinks the subsidy should only be removed when Nigeria stops importing petrol.
