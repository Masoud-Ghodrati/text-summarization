Ed and Paula Kassig plead for ISIS to release their son.
Abdul-Rahman Kassig served as a U.S. Army Ranger and went to Syria as an aid worker.
He was featured at the end of an ISIS video showing the beheading of Alan Henning.
Henning was a "local and national hero," a joint statement from 200 mosques says.
