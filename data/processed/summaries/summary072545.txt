Antonio Damasio asks: How do we become conscious of the things around us?.
In a TED Talk, he describes scientific findings about the nature of consciousness.
Our minds make maps of all the things we see, hear and sense, he says.
Damasio: We need more than the maps; it takes a sense of self to be fully conscious.
