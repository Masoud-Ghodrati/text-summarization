Polar vortex is circulation of strong, upper-level winds that normally surround the North Pole.
The distortion can lead to major cold air outbreaks in North America, Europe and Asia.
A cold air outbreak caused by the polar vortex is much more widespread than a single storm.
Research suggests the distortion could be a side effect of global warming.
