Former President George W. Bush spoke Monday at Facebook HQ in California.
He says the Wikileaks release will make it "very hard to keep the trust of foreign leaders".
Bush says he has "no desire to generate publicity," adding he's "had enough of fame".
His memoir, "Decision Points," has been a best-seller since its release two weeks ago.
