VA: About 450,000 people used Post 9/11 GI Bill benefits for college this fall.
The transition from war zone to classroom has not been easy for many vets.
San Diego State University has a Veterans Center to help ease that transition.
"Veterans have these shared life experiences," says the center's director.
