Journalist Wajahat Ali recently visited a Pakistani village that is pulling itself out of poverty.
A group has helped teach the people professional skills and financial management.
Women are playing a prominent role, too, in a place they once didn't.
Ali says the village's story runs counter to more extreme narratives in the country.
