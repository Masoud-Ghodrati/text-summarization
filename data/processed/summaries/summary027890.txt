Unicef: More than 1.7 million children in Ukraine face "extremely serious" situation.
Many families are without safe water, sanitation and access to schooling, U.N. agency says.
147 schools are currently closed in parts of the Donetsk region where fighting continues.
"Harsh winter conditions have made the impact of the crisis more acute," says Unicef official.
