Robert Goyer: 2 months after a jet landed on wrong runway, it happened again in Missouri.
How does crew get it wrong? If you've been flying a long time, it's happened to you, he says.
He says pilots turn off autopilot just before landing, don't always see it's wrong field.
Goyer: It can be deadly. A saving grace of newer jets: Great brakes, reverse thrusters.
