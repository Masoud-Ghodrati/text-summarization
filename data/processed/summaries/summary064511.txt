Peter Smithhisler: University of Virginia suspended fraternities till January after rape allegations.
He says his heart goes out to sexual assault victims, but closing fraternities is no solution.
Schools must hold assailants accountable, nor violate rights of those who follow rules, he says.
Smithhisler: Most fraternity men join for right reasons. Punish rape, but be fair to fraternities.
