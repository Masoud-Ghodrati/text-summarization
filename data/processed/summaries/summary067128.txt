Al-Awlaki and Samir Khan were two important English-language voices for al Qaeda.
Al-Awlaki built up a large following in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Many who carried out or attempted various attacks have connections to him.
At least one highly visible English-language propagandist remains: Adam Gadahn.
