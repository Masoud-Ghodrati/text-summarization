The reforms of the 1965 Voting Rights Act are under threat, says Donna Brazile.
Brazile: Lawmakers in 40 states have introduced legislation that would make it harder to vote.
Voting would be harder especially for people of color, the young and seniors, she says.
The Department of Justice must continue to safeguard American voting rights, Brazile says.
