The ex-president of Ivory Coast is facing charges of crimes against humanity.
The hearing determines whether there is sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.
Laurent Gbagbo is accused of the crimes after he rejected presidential poll results in 2010.
His refusal to step down sparked months of protests.
