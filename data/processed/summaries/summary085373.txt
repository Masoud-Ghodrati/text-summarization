Hard-line Islamist groups like the Nusra Front are becoming more popular in Syria.
They're fighting the Syrian regime while providing social services for Syrian civilians.
Some attribute their rise to Western indifference and a Free Syrian Army that's lacking.
The United States blacklisted the Nusra Front in December, labeled it terrorist.
