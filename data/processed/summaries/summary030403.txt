Computer hacker responsible for stealing passwords to financial institutions arrested, says FBI.
Police identified and arrested a 23-year-old Slovene known as "Iserdo," officials announced Wednesday.
"Iserdo" is suspected of creating and operating a computer scam that infected some 12 million computers.
This computer software was one of the "most notorious in the world," said FBI Director Robert Mueller.
