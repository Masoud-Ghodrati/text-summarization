Kelly Gallagher and Charlotte Evans will be competing at the Sochi Winter Paralympics.
The skiers enter the Games in good form, claiming top spot in a recent super-combined race.
Gallagher is visually impaired and Evans became her guide after a serious knee injury.
Gallagher says of her native Northern Ireland: "We have hills but we don't have mountains.".
