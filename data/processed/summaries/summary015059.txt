Ex-Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal sentenced to death for killing Philadelphia police officer.
He says there were procedural errors during his sentencing, too few blacks on the jury.
Appeals court can now impose death sentence or order new trial to hear claims of injustice.
"He is nothing short of an assassin." former Philadelphia district attorney says.
