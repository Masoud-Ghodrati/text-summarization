Discovery of Higgs boson can help us find dark matter particles, says physicist Sean Carroll.
Dark matter is mysterious, invisible and passes through ordinary matter.
Higgs boson could interact both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter.
Carroll says it may be possible to produce dark matter at the Large Hadron Collider.
