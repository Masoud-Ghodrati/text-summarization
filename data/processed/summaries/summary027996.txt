Gen. James D. Thurman is the new commander of U.S. and U.N. forces in Korea.
Thurman visited the DMZ, the tense border between North and South Korea, on Friday.
North Korean soldiers stood just feet away from Thurman, watching him and taking pictures.
Despite a 1953 armistice, the two Koreas have technically been at war since 1950.
