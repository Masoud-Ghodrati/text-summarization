Mohammed Ayoob says French plan to ban veils is gift to those that push anti-Westernism.
It makes European human rights advocacy hollow by using it in this case for racism, he says.
Ban is sign that Europe trying to protect "Christendom" from Muslims.
Ayoob: Veil-ban is not about women as objects, but about irrational fear of Islam in Europe.
