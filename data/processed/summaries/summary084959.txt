Muslim striker Papiss Cisse refuses to wear Newcastle's club shirt on religious grounds.
The shirt sponsor, Wonga, lends money at an annual interest rate of 5,800 percent.
Under Sharia law, making money from interest charges isn't allowed.
Cisse wore Newcastle's jersey last season when it was sponsored by Virgin Money.
