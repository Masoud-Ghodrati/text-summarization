Scotland's Scott Jamieson misses out on a historic 59 at the Portugal Masters.
Needing a birdie on the final hole to shoot the 59, he had to settle for par.
Jamieson moved into contention at the tournament, tied for second behind Paul Waring.
Earlier this year, Jim Furyk became the sixth player on the PGA Tour to tally a 59.
