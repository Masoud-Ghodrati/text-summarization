Shayanna Jenkins, Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, pleads not guilty to perjury.
Prosecutors say she wasn't truthful on what she did with a bag taken from his house.
Her lawyer calls prosecution's case "overreaching," notes Jenkins had immunity.
Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in Odin Lloyd's killing.
