Kuwait's leader dissolves parliament and calls for early elections after conflict.
Cabinet resigned earlier this week after a power struggle with the government.
The emir said he was forced to act to safeguard Kuwait's national unity.
New elections have been set for May 17 according to state-run news agency.
