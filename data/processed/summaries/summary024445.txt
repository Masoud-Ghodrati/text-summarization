Priyanka Motaparthy saw ebullient Egyptians, in solidarity with police, in streets June 30.
She says police have not reformed brutal ways of pre-2011 protests; they remain.
She says police aim violence at Brotherhood backers, don't intervene in protest conflicts.
Motaparthy: People dying in Egypt's streets; world must hold attackers accountable.
