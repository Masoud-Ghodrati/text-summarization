The donation goes to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, named for the murdered naturalist.
"Every single gorilla counts," Turner says in making his donation.
The fund aims to build new field stations and hire new staff in a conflict zone.
Turner founded CNN in 1980 but is not involved in the company now.
