The Other Hundred, a project featuring 100 photo stories, launched its first exhibition.
The project takes aim at media rankings such as the Forbes Billionaire List.
CEO: "We're trying to provoke people to define for themselves what it means to have a rich and fulfilled life".
The exhibition will move next to Mumbai, New York, Beijing and Berlin in 2014.
