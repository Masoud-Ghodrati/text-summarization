Ruthanne Lodato was shot to death when she answered a knock on her front door.
Her home is a mile from where Ronald Kirby was shot to death in November.
Nancy Dunning's 2003 unsolved shooting death happened just two miles away.
Police release a sketch of a man they suspect might be Lodato's killer.
