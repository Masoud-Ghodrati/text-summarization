Trayvon Martin, 17, was shot dead by George Zimmerman on February 26, 2012.
Zimmerman says he acted in self-defense; Martin's family says the black teen was profiled.
Martin's mother says she wants to ensure others don't suffer the pain she has.
"We're going to accept" a jury's verdict on the case, even if we don't like it, she adds.
