Martin would be alive if Zimmerman stayed in his vehicle, police said.
Trayvon Martin was pronounced dead 3 minutes after firefighters and EMS arrived.
Evidence of THC, an ingredient in marijuana, was found in Martin's blood, tests show.
Firefighters find forehead "abrasions" and "bleeding" from Zimmerman's nose.
