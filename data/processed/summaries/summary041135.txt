Milford Schools Superintendent Elizabeth Feser says school acted in "good faith".
Third-grader Ikeoluwa Opayemi was kept out of school amid Ebola fears, a lawsuit says.
She had recently returned from a trip to Lagos, Nigeria, for a family wedding.
A local health official said she was kept out school because of "rumors" and "panic".
