U.S. 101st Airborne arrived in Andar district in Afghanistan's Ghazni province 4 months ago.
It was the first American presence in the largely Taliban-controlled area in two years.
Historically the Taliban flee to their safe havens in neighboring Pakistan for winter.
Outside of this U.S. "security bubble" the fear of Taliban among population prevails.
