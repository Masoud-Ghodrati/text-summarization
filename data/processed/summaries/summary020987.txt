David Frum: Some conservatives lament U.S. has moved decisively toward socialism.
He says the reality is that the U.S. is much freer today than in 1960.
Government control of the economy and of expression is much reduced, he says.
Frum says the "strength, dynamism and creativity of the American economy" will prevail.
