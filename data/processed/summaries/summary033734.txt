The al Qaeda-linked group Al-Shabaab says it will lift a ban on aid in Somalia.
The group banned foreign aid organizations in 2009, accusing them of being anti-Muslim.
But Al-Shabaab reversed that stand on Wednesday.
Somalia and the Horn of Africa region are experiencing the worst drought in 60 years.
