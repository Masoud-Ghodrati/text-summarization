Donald Miller testified Monday that he disappeared in 1986 after losing his job.
He left behind his wife, kids and thousands of dollars in unpaid child support.
He was declared legally dead in 1994; he went to court seeking to overturn that ruling.
In Ohio, a ruling of legal death cannot be overturned after three years.
