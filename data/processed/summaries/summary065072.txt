Scotsman Andy Murray received an OBE on Thursday for his services to tennis.
Murray ended Britain's grand slam men's singles drought last year and won Wimbledon in July.
He was given the OBE medal not by the Queen but by new dad Prince William.
Murray is recovering from back surgery and won't play again this season.
