Texas Gov. Rick Perry's lawyers file a motion to toss out last month's grand jury indictment.
His lawyers argue indictment, stemming from a 2013 veto, violates separation of powers.
Perry vetoed funds for the office run by Travis County's Democratic district attorney.
Perry's lawyers ridiculed notion that like an absolute monarch, Perry could personally benefit.
