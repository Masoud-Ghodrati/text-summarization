Having overcome a shoulder injury, Maria Sharapova plans on playing for 4-5 more years.
She won her first major post-surgery at last year's French Open to complete her collection.
Russian says she enjoyed proving her doubters wrong by returning from injury.
She competes on tour while balancing business interests, including candy line.
