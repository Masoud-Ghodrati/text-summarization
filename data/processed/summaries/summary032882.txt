President Bashar al-Assad is expected to win Tuesday's presidential vote.
"It's a coronation of Assad, it's a celebration of his ability to survive," an analyst says.
It takes place amid a three-year civil war that has killed around 150,000 people.
The Syrian opposition and Western countries say the election won't be free or fair.
