Military officials are prepared to strike, waiting on President Obama's go-ahead.
Obama is "actively" reviewing target lists and has "offered guidance" to the Pentagon.
The U.S. has been flying drones over Syria, looking at areas where ISIS operates.
If top ISIS leaders can be located, they will be on the target list to strike.
