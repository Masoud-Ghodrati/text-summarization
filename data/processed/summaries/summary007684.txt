A nanny left disfigured by the Gadhafi family has left hospital in Malta.
Shweyga Mullah still faces almost daily hospital appointments.
She  was burned with boiling water by Colonel Gadhafi's daughter-in-law because she was unable to stop a child crying.
Shweyga gave thanks to the people who helped pay for her treatment and get her out of Libya.
