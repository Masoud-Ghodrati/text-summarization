Jejeon Bontinck left Belgium to join militant group Jabhat al-Nusra in Syria last year.
Bontinck's dad Dimitri decided to try to track his son down in Syria.
Al-Nusra militants nearly killed Dimitri, but ultimately led him to his son.
Jejeon, now 19, is back in Belgium and facing terrorism charges.
