Two top lawmakers say Obama should drop plan for executive action to get immigration reform.
Issue should be dealt with legislatively, says Sen. Dianne Feinstein.
"He needs to work with Congress on this," says Rep. Mike Rogers.
Obama said Saturday he would delay any action on immigration until after midterm elections.
