Reviewer: "Resident Evil: Raccoon City" not a worthy chapter in franchise.
This time, players fight for bad guys, Umbrella Corporation, against the U.S. military.
The shooter ends up feeling like a poorly lit "Call of Duty," Larry Frum says.
Frum: The game's ending also flies in the face of the franchise's story line.
