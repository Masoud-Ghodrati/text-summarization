NEW: Benjamin Colton Barnes, the suspected killer, previously was charged with DUI.
"There was no obvious sign of death" besides the cold, a sheriff's spokesman adds.
Barnes had been a communicator in the U.S. Army, an FBI agent says.
Authorities say he fatally shot a Mount Rainier park ranger on New Year's Day.
