Gilbert Gottfried: During a stand-up comedy show, Daniel Tosh made jokes about rape.
Gottfried: A woman objected. Comics make jokes; people can decide to laugh, not laugh, leave.
He says people criticized his jokes after 9-11; Aflac fired him for making Japan tsunami jokes.
Gottfried: Media, Internet like to blow things up; comedians' job to find line, step over.
