A South Carolina woman didn't like her housemate's choice of music, police say.
When the housemate wouldn't stop playing the rock band The Eagles, the two argued.
The woman grabbed kitchen knives, police said, and cut the man as the argument ran on.
The woman was arrested; the man was not seriously injured.
