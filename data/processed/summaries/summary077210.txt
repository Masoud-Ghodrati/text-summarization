Omar Hameed was a policeman in Falluja, where he worked with U.S. forces.
He says a bomb that destroyed parts of his legs was retribution for those efforts.
He, his wife and their four young children applied for U.S. asylum a year ago.
Hameed says he has no regrets, but remaining in Iraq isn't feasible.
