Rand Paul says he vowed to uphold all constitutional rights, including gun ownership.
Paul: Nothing in proposed gun laws would prevent tragedies such as the Newtown massacre.
Paul: More regulations could lead to government surveillance, disarm law-abiding people.
More senators need to stand up for the Second Amendment or rights will be lost, he says.
