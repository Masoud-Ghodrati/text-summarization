NEW: Thomas Hagan walks out of Lincoln Correctional Facility at 11 a.m..
Hagan set free a day earlier than expected; he's the only confessed killer of Malcolm X.
Hagan, 69, has been in a work-release program the past two decades.
Hagan told parole board he killed Malcolm X over his split with Nation of Islam.
