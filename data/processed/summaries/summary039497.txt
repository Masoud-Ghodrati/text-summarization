Csatary was accused of sending 15,000 Jews to the Auschwitz concentration camp.
He was arrested last year after a Jewish rights group discovered him living in Hungary.
Csatary had denied allegations against him to a British tabloid.
Lawyer: "With the death of Csatary there are no further proceedings in this case".
