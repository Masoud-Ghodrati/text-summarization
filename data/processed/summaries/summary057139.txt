Update: Clorox stated the post was a caricature and apologized again after this article published.
Clorox posted '6 mistakes new dads make' as a humorous list on its website.
The post said new dads are bad at dressing, feeding and tending their kids.
After parents took the company to task, Clorox removed the post from its website.
