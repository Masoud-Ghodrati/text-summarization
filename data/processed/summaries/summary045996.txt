Desmond Lachman: IMF bailout of Greece, Ireland and Portugal puts the U.S. taxpayer at risk.
Potential massive IMF lending to Italy and Spain would be even more risky, Lachman says.
U.S. taxpayers' exposure to Italy and Spain could be on the order of $220 billion, he says.
Lachman: Obama administration owes it to the U.S. public to be up front about the potential cost.
