Funke Opeke is the chief executive of Nigeria's Main One Cable Company.
She says her firm laid the first sub-sea cable linking West Africa and Europe to bring broadband to the region.
The fiber-optic cable runs from Seixal in Portugal to Accra in Ghana and Lagos in Nigeria.
Opeke says the lack of a backbone, open-access infrastructure is keeping prices high for consumers.
