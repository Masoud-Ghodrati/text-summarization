NEW: Drilling doesn't turn up bones, body parts or other evidence, police chief says.
A tipster told police that a body was buried at a home about the time of Hoffa's disappearance.
Crews took soil samples and will test them for human remains; results are expected Monday.
Former Teamsters leader Hoffa disappeared in 1975.
