NEW: Pope: Cross represents God's response to evil -- which is love and forgiveness.
He makes these remarks to close a Stations of the Cross ceremony at Rome's Colosseum.
Earlier, he'd participated in a service about the Lord's Passion at St. Peter's Basilica.
The Vatican rebuts "concerns" over Francis's washing 2 women's feet Thursday.
