Bionic leg is the result of a nine-year research effort led by Michael Goldfarb at Vanderbilt.
The world's first fully robotic leg allows amputees to run and navigate inclines naturally.
The technology was bought by Freedom Innovations and is slated to be released in 2014.
One of its first users is a young man who lost his leg in a shark attack in Florida.
