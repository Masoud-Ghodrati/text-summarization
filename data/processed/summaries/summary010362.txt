Steve Hitner worked to reform state alimony law after he went bankrupt trying to pay.
He remarried and some of his second wife's income went to Hitner's alimony payments.
Hitner: New law has guidelines and sets reasonable length of time for payments.
He says many states are considering new laws that don't financially ruin the payer.
