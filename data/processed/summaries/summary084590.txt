Five deaths from unprovoked shark attacks reported within ten months in Western Australia.
While number of deaths is unusual, "no scientific evidence" to suggest increase in sharks.
Shark encounters remain very low, with annual average of 16 encounters over the last decade.
Government has committed US$14M over five years for shark attack research and prevention.
