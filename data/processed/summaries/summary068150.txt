Weeks of fighting between Kurds and ISIS have devastated the Kurdish city of Kobani.
Some people remain but food and fuel are scarce and mortars rain down.
Female Kurdish fighters are among those battling ISIS in the shell-blasted streets.
"I lost a lot of friends in this war and I resist to avenge their death," says one fighter.
