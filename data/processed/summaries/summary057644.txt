Frankie Dettori made history in 1996 by riding seven winners in seven races.
Feat made Italian jockey famous, punters cleaned up, bookmakers lost out.
Dettori bought final horse, Fujiyama Crest, now retired and Dettori family pet.
Final post has pride of place in Frankie's garden near home in Newmarket.
