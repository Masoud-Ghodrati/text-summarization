Stacey Nicole English, 36, was last seen just after Christmas, witnesses tell police.
Police want to talk again with the man who stayed with her before her disappearance.
He earlier told police that she'd said the world was ending and ordered him to leave.
The woman's car was found abandoned and running in south Atlanta, police say.
