Puerto Rican college graduate shares her story on why she left the island.
S&P cut Puerto Rico's credit rating to junk status last month in face of $70 billion debt.
"I was sharing an apartment with 6 others and my expenses were still 70% of my salary".
Graduate says she hasn't given up on her goal to improve things in Puerto Rico.
