Halliburton was a contractor for BP at the ill-fated Deepwater Horizon oil drilling operation.
BP and its contractors have been locked in legal battles since last year.
An explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon killed 11 and injured 16.
The explosion led to more than 200 million gallons of oil being released into the Gulf of Mexico.
