The world standard for high-speed rail is 186 mph to 220 mph, industry experts say.
The California project will be the only U.S. line reaching those speeds, officials say.
California Gov. Jerry Brown signs a bill funding the first leg of high-speed rail line.
The new line eventually will connect Los Angeles and San Francisco.
