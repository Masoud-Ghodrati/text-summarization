Cleveland Police Officer Timothy Loehmann shot and killed a 12-year-old boy.
Records show he had resigned from a past police job in a Cleveland suburb.
Former supervisor: He showed "lack of maturity, indiscretion and not following instructions".
Cleveland Police say they never saw the personnel file that detailed criticism.
