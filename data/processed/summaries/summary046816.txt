Mitt Romney's campaign drew a blank when asked if it supports the Lilly Ledbetter Act.
Lilly Ledbetter: It's insulting that Romney wouldn't give a straight answer on whether he would sign the law.
She says pay equality is not just about fairness, it's about economic security for all families.
Ledbetter: Romney's positions would mean that women would face economic setbacks.
