4 black women in their 50s and 60s were allegedly attacked while at home alone, police say.
They were all alumnae of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.
The alleged attacker -- black and in his 30s or 40s -- knew personal info about his victims.
Authorities have not named anyone, though they've released a video of a possible suspect.
