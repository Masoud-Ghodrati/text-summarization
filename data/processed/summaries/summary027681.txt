Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal talks with CNN's Larry King in prime-time exclusive.
Jindal says he hopes people judge content of his speech, not just delivery.
"I think Rush [Limbaugh] is a great leader for conservatives," Jindal says.
Jindal: Republicans became captive to Washington politics, lost elections as result.
