NEW: Lee Rigby's fiancee says she's "devastated" and "moved" by tributes to him.
Adebowale was one of two wounded, arrested right after the May 22 attack.
He's charged with murder and unlawful possession of a firearm, police say.
He was discharged from a hospital Tuesday, and will appear in court Thursday.
