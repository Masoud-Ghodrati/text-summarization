NATO releases satellite photos purportedly showing Russian military buildup near Ukraine.
Photos, reportedly taken just weeks ago, show jets, tanks, and troops amassing near border.
Russia says photos were taken last August -- NATO says claim is "categorically false".
NATO official says Russia has up to 40,000 troops ready to invade Ukraine if called upon.
