Ontario court rules federal prostitution laws unfairly discriminate against prostitutes.
A prostitute should be able "to work indoors, in a location under her control," the judges write.
The ruling does not allow prostitutes to solicit customers on the streets.
Supporters of the ruling say federal laws will now have to change.
