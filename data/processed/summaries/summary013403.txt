Two people, including Missouri State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, are detained by police Monday night.
Protesters have been calling for an officer's indictment after unarmed teen Michael Brown was killed.
Investigators found Brown's blood on the officer's gun, uniform and cruiser, sources say.
Protester: "If there is not an indictment, excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose.".
