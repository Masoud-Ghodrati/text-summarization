Thomas Ken Owens, 38, tried to hire a hit-man to kill his uncle, authorities say.
The purported hit man was an informant, according to court papers.
The alleged intended victim was Owens' uncle, Ernest Widby, a pastor and bailiff.
Owens ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in 2012.
