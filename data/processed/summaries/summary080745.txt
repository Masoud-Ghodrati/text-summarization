A smartphone app called FireChat has emerged as the messaging tool of choice for Hong Kong protesters.
The 'off-the-grid' app works by creating its own network outside the internet.
The company registered 500,000 downloads in Hong Kong alone within two weeks.
Other emerging services are exploiting the same 'mesh-network' technology.
