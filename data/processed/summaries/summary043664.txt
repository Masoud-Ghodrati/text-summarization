Pattern of Aleppo attacks appears designed to terrify civilians rather than target rebels.
In one strike rockets collapsed a two-story building with an extended family inside.
Locals pulled 11 bodies from the rubble and one baby survivor.
The baby boy was apparently protected from the blast by his mom as she breastfed him.
