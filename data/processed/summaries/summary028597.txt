David Frum: President Obama has a record that should be questioned in the debates.
He says Obama should be asked about results of Afghan surge and "green-on-blue" attacks.
Frum: Ask about slow economic recovery and what level of taxation he thinks is too high.
Ask Obama how he would govern differently in second term, Frum says.
