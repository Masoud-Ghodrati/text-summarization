Ilya Shapiro: Federal judge in Va. says government can't mandate health insurance purchase.
He says this is a correct reading of the Constitution's "Commerce Clause".
Mandating health insurance is akin to forcing people to buy a consumer product, he says.
Shapiro: Case is far from settled and will probably go to the U.S. Supreme Court.
