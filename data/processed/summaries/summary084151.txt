Samuel Moyn: WWI launched debate: can laws of war impose limits how war carried out?.
After WWI, aim was to end war, but in 100 years, aim shifted to making it more 'humane,' he says.
Moyn: Focus now not to end nations' aggression, but to stop atrocity. Vietnam a low point.
Since 9/11, our wars much cleaner, lawful; but WWI idea of 'war to end wars' failed, he says.
