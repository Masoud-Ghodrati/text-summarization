An investigation is under way into a near-collision last week over Hong Kong.
The incident was not reported publicly until a Hong Kong newspaper revealed it Tuesday.
Aviation and airline officials say passengers were never at risk.
It's at least the fourth near-collision over Hong Kong in 11 years.
