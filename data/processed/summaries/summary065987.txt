Pit and Barrel bar owner Chris Farrell tells police he shot Mills in self-defense.
Police are investigating Ferrell's claim that the shooting was justified.
Mills is "a stiff-necked, country troubadour with an affinity for honky-tonks," his website says.
He's "steeped in the Southern vernacular of God, guns and football," his website says.
