March 14 marks one year since Xi Jinping was officially appointed China's president.
After Xi's first presidential speech, the "Chinese dream" became a household phrase.
Xi's campaign against corruption can be seen as the first steps to restore public trust, says Xie.
Xie says reforms will enable all people in China to be truly proud of the Chinese dream.
