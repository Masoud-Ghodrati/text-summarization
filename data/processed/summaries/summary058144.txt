Matthew Myers: High Court upholds racketeering ruling on Big Tobacco, which lied to public.
Myers says it's time to fund education and stop-smoking campaigns.
Tobacco industry spends $35 million daily to market its deadly products, Myers writes.
Big Tobacco undermines laws to control it, he says, so it's urgent to impose remedies.
