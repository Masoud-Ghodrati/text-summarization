NFL referees already returned to work in Thursday night's game.
Saturday's ratification was a formality, establishing an eight-year contract, the longest ever.
Union refs' salary will rise: $149k in 2001 to $173k in 2013, topping out at $205k by 2019.
The league will be allowed to hire additional referees so that they can be trained.
