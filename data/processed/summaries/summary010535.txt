Speed skater Charles Hamelin says his sport is like walking on a wire in the air.
Hamelin is a two-time Olympic gold medalist and has eight World Championship titles.
When he is racing he says the only voice in the crowd he can hear is that of his girlfriend's.
Hamelin says it isn't the strongest but the smartest competitor who succeeds.
