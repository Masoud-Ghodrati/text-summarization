Iran warns it could block Strait of Hormuz if sanctions are imposed on crude oil exports.
Strait is important strategic chokepoints; third of all oil shipped worldwide passes through.
Iran has threatened several times to close the Strait but it has never carried through with it.
U.S. says "we'll do what we must" to keep Strait open; prospect of conflict unnerves markets.
