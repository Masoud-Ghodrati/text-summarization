A U.S. Coast Guard vessel was on a routine operation in the Persian Gulf.
The Pentagon said an Iranian fishing boat pointed a gun at a Coast Guard patrol.
The Coast Guard crew fired a single shot in response, ending the incident.
No one was hurt, according to the Pentagon and the Iranian boat left the area.
