Suu Kyi and 33 other members of her party were elected to the lower house.
They had delayed their parliamentary debuts over the wording of the oath of office.
The oath of office is a historic moment in Myanmar's recent reforms.
A previous election success by Suu Kyi's party in 1990 was ignored by the military rulers.
