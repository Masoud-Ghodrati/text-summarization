Oscar Pistorius is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in February 2013.
Pistorius admits killing Steenkamp but denies murder, saying he mistook her for an intruder.
He was involved in a dispute at a nightclub Saturday, his spokeswoman says.
Pistorius subsequently posted a series of tweets, his first activity on Twitter since February.
