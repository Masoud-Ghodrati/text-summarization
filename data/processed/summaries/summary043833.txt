About 1,100 women served in the Women Airforce Service Pilots program in World War II.
Female pilots ferried military planes around the country to allow men to fight overseas.
A bill that would have made the program part of the military failed in Congress in 1944.
Members of the program were awarded Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.
