Malala Yousafzai will return to address leaders at the United Nations in September.
Gordon Brown, the U.N. special education envoy, will visit Pakistan and Nigeria this year.
Both are calling for all children around the world to be given access to education.
"Malala's speech was just the start of a momentous push for change," says Brown.
