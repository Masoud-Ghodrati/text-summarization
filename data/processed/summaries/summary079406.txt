A video is aired Monday by America TV and other Peruvian news organizations.
Van der Sloot tells police he killed Stephany Flores and describes how he did it.
He was arrested in June 2010 and charged this month in the woman's death.
His lawyer has said his client would confess to "simple homicide" but not other charges.
