ISIS has published what it claims is an "interview" with a Jordanian pilot captured in Syria.
ISIS says it downed an F-16 manned by Moaz al-Kassasbeh during coalition air strikes.
A still image of al-Kassasbeh wearing an orange jumpsuit tops the short article.
The magazine also contains an article claimed to have been authored by Briton John Cantlie.
