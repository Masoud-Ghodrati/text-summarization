Mary Ellen O'Connell says capturing suspect in Benghazi attack is a good sign.
She says it represents the U.S. returning to using the law to fight terrorism.
O'Connell: Until now, the U.S. has relied heavily on unlawful drone attacks.
U.S. courts, not military commissions, are right venue for trials of terrorists, she says.
