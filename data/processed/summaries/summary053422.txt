Brother and sister team is representing Israel in ice dancing.
Roman and Alexandra Zaretsky hope to inspire kids in Israel to take up the sport.
Born in Belarus, they moved to Israel, but came to U.S. for better training facilities.
They were 22nd at the 2006 games but feel they can do better in Vancouver.
