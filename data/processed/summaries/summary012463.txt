Czech judges ruled that concert promoters were to blame for the death of a Lamb of God fan.
Frontman Randy Blythe pushed the 19-year-old off the stage a concert in May 2010.
The sober Czech teenager hit his head and eventually slipped into a coma and died weeks later.
Blythe had pledged "to serve my sentence like a man" if found guilty by the Czech courts.
