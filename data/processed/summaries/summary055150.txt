25 years on from the first World AIDS Day, much progress has been made in fight against AIDS.
Erin Hohlfelder says 16 African countries have passed the "beginning of end of AIDS" tipping point.
"Treatment now works better, and costs less, allowing people with AIDS to live long, productive lives".
But Hohlfelder says we must not allow complacency to set in; there is still much to be done.
