Paul Begala: As we gorge at Thanksgiving, GOP House wants to cut food stamps for millions.
He says SNAP gives a small amount of money to the very poor; comes out to $1.50 a meal.
GOP Rep. Fincher, who voted to cut, got $3.48 million in farm taxpayer subsidies, he says.
Begala: Economists say food stamps spur economic growth; GOP should restore them.
