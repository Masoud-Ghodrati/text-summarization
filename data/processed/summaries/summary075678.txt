A baby was surrendered on Christmas Eve at a Los Angeles fire station.
The 27-year-old mother said the girl was only 6 hours old, a fire spokesman says.
She is healthy and will be placed in protective custody, he adds.
In California, a parent can drop off a newborn at fire stations with no fear of arrest.
