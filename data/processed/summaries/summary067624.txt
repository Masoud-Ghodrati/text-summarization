Three new national polls indicate a majority of Americans support most gun control measures.
Polls divided by political party, gender, age, race and education over some proposals.
Pew Survey: 85% of the public backs background checks on private gun sales and at shows.
ABC/Wash Post poll: 44% of people who own at least one gun less supportive of proposals.
