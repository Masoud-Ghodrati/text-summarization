Andrea Jaime was a student at Georgetown's Nursing and Health Studies school.
She posted to Twitter late last week that she had a high fever, "I think I'm dying".
Jamie dies of what officials believe is meningitis; tests are being done to confirm.
Meningitis outbreaks have been reported at universities in New Jersey, California.
