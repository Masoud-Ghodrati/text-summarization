Lava from a vent has come within a mile of the edge of the Ka'ohe Homesteads subdivision.
Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi declares an emergency, asks Gov. Neil Abercrombie for help.
U.S. Geological Survey says the lava could reach a subdivision boundary in less than a week.
No evacuations have been ordered, but access to roadways to the community is restricted.
