Formula One returns to Bahrain amid anti-government protests.
FIA president Jean Todt says the sport's return to Bahrain can have a "healing effect".
Some protesters say the race is a chance to raise awareness of the country's political plight.
Other human rights groups have called for the race to be canceled.
