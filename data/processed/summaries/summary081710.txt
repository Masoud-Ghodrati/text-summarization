Veteran Tracey Cooper-Harris married her same-sex partner four years ago.
In 2010, she was diagnosed with a disease connected to her service and received benefits.
She later sought additional disability compensation for her spouse.
The VA denied the additional benefits, and the couple filed a federal discrimination lawsuit.
