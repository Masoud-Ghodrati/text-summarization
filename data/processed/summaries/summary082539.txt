Justice Stevens stood firmly for the rule of law, his former law clerk says.
Robert Schapiro says Stevens held presidents to account, said they were not above the law.
Stevens believed everyone, regardless of means, should have access to courts, he says.
Schapiro: The law requires standing up to presidents and standing up for the nameless.
