Lawyer: Bryce Reed pleads guilty to conspiracy to possess a destructive device.
An affidavit says he gave someone components for a pipe bomb.
Reed was among the first responders at a West, Texas, plant explosion that left 15 dead.
He insists the charges aren't related to the blast; authorities haven't connected them.
