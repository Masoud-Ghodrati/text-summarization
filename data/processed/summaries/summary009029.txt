Kathleen McCartney: Gloria Steinem changed rules on what it mean to be a woman.
In 70's Steinem co-founded Ms. magazine to upend sexist status quo. McCartney was hooked.
Steinem helped her find voice to seek posts reserved for males, resist 'policed' gender roles.
McCartney: Steinem's work still resonant, necessary; we don't live in post-gendered world.
