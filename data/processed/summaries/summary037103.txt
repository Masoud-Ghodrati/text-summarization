Kagan sought to block military recruiters from Harvard because of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell".
Said in memo, "I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy".
Documents show decision allowing military access made by school president, not Kagan.
Leahy says Kagan acted responsibly and allowed recruiters at Harvard Law School.
