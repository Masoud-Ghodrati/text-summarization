Pope John XXIII is to be canonized, or made into a saint, in the Vatican on Sunday.
Known as "The Good Pope," he reigned from 1958 until his death in 1963.
He was born in poverty and said he was happy to die poor; he left relatives $20 in his will.
Elected as an "interim" pope, he instead proved the most daring pontiff in decades.
