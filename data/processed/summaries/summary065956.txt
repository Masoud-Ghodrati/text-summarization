A Thai court has issued warrants for four Iranians in relation to bombings in Bangkok.
The police say they want to arrest a fifth person, a 52-year-old man.
The Bangkok blasts came after bombs targeted Israelis in India and Georgia.
Israel and Iran have traded accusations over who is to blame for the bombings.
