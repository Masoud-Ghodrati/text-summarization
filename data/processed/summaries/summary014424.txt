Anti-drone activist and journalist Kareem Khan is freed, nine days after his abduction.
Khan says he was seized by armed men, taken to a basement and tortured.
His abductors hung him upside down, beat his feet and shackled him, he says.
Khan was due to travel to Europe to talk to lawmakers about drone strikes that killed relatives.
