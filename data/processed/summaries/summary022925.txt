Nicolas Henin tells reporters Mehdi Nemmouche beat him during captivity in Syria.
Nemmouche is accused in the shooting of four people at the Jewish Museum in Belgium.
Henin, a reporter for Le Point, alleges that Nemmouche used to beat and torture prisoners.
Henin was freed in April after 10 months in captivity, part of which he spent with James Foley.
