At least $5 million has been donated to the Aurora Victims Relief Fund.
Relatives of victims say their demands on how to spend the money have been ignored.
All money will go to meet the needs of the victims and families, foundation official says.
Checks for $5,000 were sent to each of the 70 victims' families earlier this month.
