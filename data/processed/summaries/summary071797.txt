Lynne Spalding Ford checked into a San Francisco hospital on September 19.
She disappeared two days later, but a full search of the hospital didn't start for another week.
Technical problems delayed the viewing of surveillance footage, the sheriff's department says.
Her body was found in a remote stairwell 17 days after her disappearance.
