Yaroslav Kolchin, who was visiting from Moscow, has been arrested.
He faces charges of reckless endangerment, criminal trespass and other counts.
Official says Kolchin reached the top of one of the towers and snapped iPhone pictures.
In July, two U.S. flags atop the bridge were replaced with white flags.
