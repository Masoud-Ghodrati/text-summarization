Joseph Shaun Goodman's seventh DUI is a misdemeanor under Washington state law.
He drove his Ferrari above 90 mph fleeing police, crashing into two cars and a house.
Judge gives Goodman work-release because jailing him would hurt his employees.
Protesters charge that "wealthy are playing by a different set of rules".
