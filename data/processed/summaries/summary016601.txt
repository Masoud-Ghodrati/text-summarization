Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are on the cover of Vogue magazine's April issue.
West had previously said he believed there was no reason Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover.
The couple's daughter North was also present at the photo shoot.
The issue arrives digitally March 24 and on newsstands March 31.
