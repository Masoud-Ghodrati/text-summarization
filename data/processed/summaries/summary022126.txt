Alfred Wright was missing for almost three weeks before volunteers found his body.
A coroner's report says his body was filled with drugs, and his death was ruled accidental.
Family members say they never saw him do drugs, nor did his personality suggest that he did.
Texas Rangers say the death is questionable and have called in the FBI to help investigate.
