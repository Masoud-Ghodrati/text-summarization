Twenty-three students allege Columbia University failed to protect victims of sexual assault.
Complaint filed with U.S. Department of Education also includes Barnard College.
Columbia says it hasn't seen complaint, can't comment on allegations.
Students: "Columbia is more willing to silence and punish survivors and their supporters".
