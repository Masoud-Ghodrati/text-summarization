Nancy Garrido faces charges with her husband in abduction of Jaycee Lee Dugard.
Her attorney says media coverage has included "misstatements ...  speculation".
Attorney Gilbert Maines says he's working on getting Nancy Garrido to confide in him.
Maines says the case is "horrendous" for Nancy Garrido as well as the victims.
