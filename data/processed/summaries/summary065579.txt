PETN explosive is a white powder which is hard to ignite but easy to conceal.
PETN devices could have been "murderous," explosives expert tells CNN.
Alleged "underwear bomber" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab also used PETN, authorities say.
Investigators believe devices may have been made by same bomb-maker.
