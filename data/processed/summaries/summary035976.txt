NASA is guiding a team building a bio-drone that can self-destruct and leave no trace if it crashes.
The drone is made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers called mycelium.
The unmanned aerial vehicle is also coated in substance made from a protein found in wasp spit.
NASA says the UAV could be used to fly into environmentally sensitive areas such as coral reefs.
