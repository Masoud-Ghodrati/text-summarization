Investigators have been looking into claim that Lohan tussled with an employee.
Officials expect a copy of the investigation to go to a district attorney's office this week.
Authorities say the former staffer will "no longer be cooperating in the investigation".
Lohan is free to leave court-ordered rehab this week.
