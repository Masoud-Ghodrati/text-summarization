The House bill passed Saturday night protects the fees of trial lawyers, Frum says.
He says states that have capped fees have seen increase in doctors.
When Texas capped fees, lawsuits fell and doctors moved to the state, he says.
Frum: Trial lawyers are benefiting because they provide campaign funds for Democrats.
