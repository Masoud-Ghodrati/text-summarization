55 people have been sentenced on terror charges in a stadium "show trial" in China.
Three were sentenced to death in the stadium in Xinjiang, before 7,000 spectators.
The trial is part of a response to a string of terror attacks linked to the Uyghur minority.
Amnesty International has slammed the stadium trial as "deplorable".
