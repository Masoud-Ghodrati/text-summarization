Fabrice Muamba wants FIFA to put player welfare at the center of Qatar 2022 decision.
Muamba retired after suffering on-field cardiac arrest in March 2012.
The former England Under-21 midfielder's heart stopped for 78 minutes.
No decision on the scheduling of Qatar 2022 will be made until after 2014 World Cup.
