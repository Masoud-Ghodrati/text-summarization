Tai Shan, a 4-year-old giant panda, is to be delivered to China next week.
A farewell party was held at the National Zoo in Washington on Saturday.
He'll be joined in China by Mei Lan -- a 3-year-old panda born at Zoo Atlanta in Georgia.
They will take part in a breeding program aimed at increasing China's panda population.
