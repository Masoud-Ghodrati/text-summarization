Malala Yousafzai, 15, has become a global symbol for girls' education worldwide.
She was shot in October by the Pakistan Taliban, which she defied by going to school.
But instead of silencing Malala, the shooting has only served to strengthen her voice.
She is now attending school in the UK; in July, she will speak at the United Nations.
