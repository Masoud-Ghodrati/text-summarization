British BMX rider Shanaze Reade is a gold medal favorite for London 2012.
Reade crashed out of the inaugural BMX final in Beijing four years ago.
The IOC announced BMX as an Olympic sport in 2003 and it made its debut in 2008.
The 23-year-old Reade considered quitting BMX after her China nightmare.
