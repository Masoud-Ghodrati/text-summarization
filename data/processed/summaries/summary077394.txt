Marion Bartoli has no plans to return to the tennis tour after retiring in August.
The Wimbledon champion is enjoying life away from the court and devoting more time to art.
Bartoli says scars from childhood drove her even more to become a tennis champion.
Bartoli didn't expect to win Wimbledon since she was ill and in pain the previous week.
