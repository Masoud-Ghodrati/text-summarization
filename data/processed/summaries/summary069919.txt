Queen Elizabeth II and Royal family lay wreaths at the Cenotaph, the war memorial near Parliament in London.
Britain honors its war dead each year on the Sunday closest to November 11, the day World War I ended in 1918.
Hours before the ceremony began, the 200th British soldier was been killed in hostile action in Afghanistan.
That was followed by the news that a U.S. soldier and another British soldier died in separate incidents.
