Two employees at a Subway in central Ohio have been fired after posting photos online.
One showed genitals on a loaf of bread; the other a bottle allegedly filled with frozen urine.
"These actions are not tolerated," Subway says in a statement.
After hearing what happened, a customer says, "I think I want to go home and consider puking".
