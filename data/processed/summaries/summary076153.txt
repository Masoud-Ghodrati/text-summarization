Belfast court has a heavy police presence as 14 defendants go on trial in large terrorism case.
Trial could last three months and is likely to be one of Northern Ireland's most expensive ever.
Nine of the men face murder charges in the 2000 killing of a rival paramiltary leader.
Rival groups were responsible for deaths of hundreds during conflict known as the Troubles.
