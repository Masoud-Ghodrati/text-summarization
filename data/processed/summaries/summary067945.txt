ISIS produces a document, "Question and Answers on Female Slaves and their Freedom".
It has been posted online, and armed men distributed it to residents of Mosul.
In it, ISIS claims the Quran justifies taking non-Muslim women and girls captive.
It also says they can be sold as "property," and that sex with captive girls is permissible.
