Cartersville, Georgia, man says police "strapped to the gills" came to his house last week.
A helicopter belonging to a drug task force mistook his okra plants for cannabis, police say.
Police: Okra plants, cannabis plants have "quite a number of characteristics" in common.
Jokes aside, man worries: "The more I thought about it, what could have happened?".
