Rep. John Dingell became longest-serving member of Congress on Friday.
Dingell's record eclipses that of former Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia.
Contrast that with the 60 days that Dean Barkley served to finish Paul Wellstone's term.
Dingell and his father, John Dingell Sr., served a total of 80 years in Congress.
