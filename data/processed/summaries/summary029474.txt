The new TSA program comes in the wake of an incident involving a Marine.
Airport screeners in Phoenix reportedly made the Marine remove his prosthetic legs.
The TSA disputes details of that incident, but announces a new program for "wounded warriors".
The program will expedite screenings for active-duty and inactive "wounded warriors".
