Carol Costello: Donald Sterling made charitable gifts to civil rights groups.
She says he had history of housing discrimination, but organizations took his money.
Some say they will keep the money while local NAACP says it will return it, she says.
Costello: Is it a betrayal for these groups to take his money?.
