North Korea plans to erect a statue of Kim Jong Il and build towers across the country.
His body will lie in state in the Pyongyang palace that houses the corpse of Kim Il Sung.
Kim Jong Il's death, announced last month, has put the region on edge.
The regime says his birthday will now be known as "the Day of the Shining Star".
