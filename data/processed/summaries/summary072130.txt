At 63, rocker Ted Nugent is still playing music, with no plans to stop.
Nugent: "In order to maintain that intensity, I have to get away from it" -- by hunting.
Between tours, charity and speaking events, he relaxes at homes in Michigan and Texas.
Among his regrets: He didn't go to his mom's funeral.
