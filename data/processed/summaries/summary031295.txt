An activist and a pastor say the pope told them he supported civil unions in Argentina.
Reports say the pope also pushed bishops to support the idea at a 2010 meeting.
As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the pope was a vocal opponent to same-sex marriage.
The pope once called same-sex marriage "a destructive attack on God's plan".
