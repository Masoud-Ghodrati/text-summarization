The Lyubov Orlova was built in 1976 as an arctic cruise ship for elite Russian travelers.
In 2012, the abandoned ship was accidentally lost at sea and believed to be infested with cannibal rats.
Recently, media publications have warned that the ship might actually strike the coast of Ireland or the UK.
