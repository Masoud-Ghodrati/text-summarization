NEW: A vigil is held at Virginia Tech on Thursday night; another is set for Friday.
Video from a slain police officer's car shows a man with a gun, just before shooting.
The man on the video matches the description of a person later found shot dead.
A state police major says "we cannot say definitively" the dead man shot the officer.
