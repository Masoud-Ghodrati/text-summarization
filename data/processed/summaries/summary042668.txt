Ticketmaster was supposed to distribute tickets to the Inaugural balls and parade.
They mistakenly released the tickets early, and they were sold out when most of the public went looking for them.
Thousands were shut out, upset at the snafu.
The Presidential Inaugural Committee said no more tickets are available.
