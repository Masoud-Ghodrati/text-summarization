A 6-year-old boy and two others fall into waters in a Sioux Falls park.
The boy is rescued, but the two others -- one of them his sister -- aren't.
Authorities find the sister's body Friday; they're still looking for the man.
"Everybody here is essentially eyes on the water," a fire chief says of the search.
