The Airbus A300-600ST -- better known as the Beluga -- took its maiden flight on September 13, 1994.
The Beluga was designed to end Airbus' reliance on the Boeing Super Guppy.
Airbus' five Belugas are made to transport huge items, such as aircraft wings.
Airbus may be looking at a potential "Beluga XL" replacement.
