Bo Xilai stripped of Communist Party posts for unspecified "serious breach of (Communist Party) discipline".
Popular but controversial official was sacked last month as Communist Party chief of Chongqing.
His wife, Gu Kailai, and a family aide arrested in connection with mysterious death of British businessman.
Bo's dismissal has triggered political in-fighting in the Communist Party ahead of political transition.
