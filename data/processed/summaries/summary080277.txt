Paleontologists say they found a new dinosaur species, Siats meekerorum, in Utah.
At more than 30 feet long and over 4 tons, it was a dominant carnivore predator.
It predates T. rex, filling a hole in the geologic record from 100 million years ago.
Its closet kin were in other continents, indicating dinosaurs spread widely.
