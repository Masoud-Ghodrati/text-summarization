Kainat Riaz Ahmed and Shazia Ramzan are to be honored for bravery, a minister says.
The Sitara-e- jurrat, or star of courage, is the third highest military award in Pakistan.
The girls were injured along with Malala Yousufzai in an attack on their school van.
Malala's efforts to ensure girls' rights to education have won international acclaim.
