Latino legislators met recently to seek progress on status of "DREAM'ers".
Ruben Navarrette says it's encouraging that they're talking about a compromise.
He asks: Will political parties let that happen, or kill it to preserve a campaign issue?.
Navarrette: Marco Rubio's proposal isn't perfect but it does show progress.
