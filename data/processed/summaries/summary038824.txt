Film director Michael Bay is behind movies including the "Transformers" series.
He was on stage to help promote Samsung's new curved TV at the CES show.
The five-day conference in Las Vegas is the world's top tech gadget show.
Bay appeared to get stage fright, apologizing and walking off, blaming the teleprompter.
