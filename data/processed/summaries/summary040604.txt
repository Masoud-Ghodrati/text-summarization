FAA reports more than 900 cases of unruly behavior on planes over past five years.
Last month, a man reportedly exposed himself to passenger on Southwest Airlines.
FBI officials say bad behavior less tolerated on flights after September 11 attacks.
Unruly behavior can bring civil fines up to $25,000 or criminal charges.
