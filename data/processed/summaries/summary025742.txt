Two Palestinian towns have been home to weekly protests opposing separation barrier.
700-kilometer stretch of concrete wall and fence separates Israel from West Bank.
Protest sites will be closed between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. every Friday.
Gaby Lasky, a lawyer representing village residents, said the military order is illegal.
