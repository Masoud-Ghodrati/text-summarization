"The Exorcist" is about the demonic possession of a girl and the priests who save her.
Some of the film's scenes are considered just as shocking today as they were in 1973.
Many people consider "The Exorcist" to be the scariest movie of all time.
Director William Friedkin, however, did not treat it as a horror film.
