Tamar Jacoby: In recent years many states have taken issue of immigration into their own hands.
She says when Supreme Court rules on SB 1070 it will be making a judgment on federalism.
She says states that have tried pragmatic approaches run up against federal immigration law.
Jacoby: SB 1070 should fall, but if not, ruling should let states experiment on immigration policy.
