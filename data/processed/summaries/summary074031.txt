Pedro Valdez repeatedly tried, failed to get appointments with Phoenix VA, his daughter says.
He ended up being hospitalized before seeing a VA doctor; he died in January.
The VA hasn't responded to this specific claim, but is looking into general allegations.
Valdez's daughter: The VA "kicked him when he was down, when he needed them".
