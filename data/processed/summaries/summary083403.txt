House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has forged a deal over the party's leadership structure.
Rep. Steny Hoyer will become the Democratic whip, Rep. Jim Clyburn will be Assistant Leader.
The "Assistant Leader" position is a new, third-ranking leadership post.
Clyburn supports the deal, saying it "honors the diversity" of Democrats in the House.
