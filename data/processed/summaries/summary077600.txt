Two LAPD cops patrol in the ex-cop's old beat, saying they "don't think he'll bring the fight into L.A.".
All 10,000 LAPD officers are on tactical alert, with one stating: "We're maxed deployed".
Meanwhile, two patrolling sheriff's deputies are on edge as ex-cop has pledged to kill police.
"He's a scary guy," a 24-year veteran deputy says.
