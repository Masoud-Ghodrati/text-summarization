Libyan media: Retired Gen. Khalifa Haftar leads offensive against Benghazi militants.
Offensive includes Libyan military forces, but attack not authorized by Tripoli, government says.
Acting Prime Minister says unauthorized action amounts to "coup".
At least 12 killed, 91 injured in Benghazi-area clashes, state-run news agency says.
