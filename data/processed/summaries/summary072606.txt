Mayor Michael Bloomberg said police officers should go on strike for better gun control.
Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Mayor was wrong about strike, but right about dangers police face.
Police face gun lobby, cowardly politicians, pop culture that glorifies violence, he says.
Elected officials and police unions should act to keep police safe, Navarrette says.
