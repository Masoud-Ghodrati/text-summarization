Eastbound highway traffic was shut down for four hours after the crash.
A tractor-trailer was heading west on I-10 when it crossed the divide.
It struck a van going the opposition way, killing all 7 van passengers, a state official says.
The truck's passengers are both in serious condition at a Phoenix hospital, he adds.
