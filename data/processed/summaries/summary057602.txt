The U.S. Open will have a retractable roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium as early as 2016.
The tournament has been affected by rain since 2008, leading to Monday finals.
New and bigger second and third show courts will also be constructed on site.
This year's tournament will be without Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who pulled out injured.
