Neal Gabler: Rooney was very unusual in Hollywood. A child actor with enduring success.
He says he had quality unlike male stars of Golden Age: not powerful, but plucky, vulnerable.
He conquered through energy, determination, not strength. His image was hopeful, sincere.
Gabler: He expressed how Americans wanted to see themselves.
