A controversial tweet from @colbertreport raised a firestorm over racial satire.
Aaron Schiller: Though Stephen Colbert didn't post it, he should apologize.
He says the tweet, taken from a line he spoke, is offensive for Asian-Americans.
Schiller: Just because he is a comedian doesn't mean he can tell offensive jokes.
