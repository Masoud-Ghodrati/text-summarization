U.S. forces have handed a tanker with an illegal oil shipment back to Libya.
Three armed Libyans who had taken control of the tanker are also handed over.
The transfer of the Morning Glory "went smoothly and as planned".
Rebel leader claims the tanker is legal and those on board should not be handed to Libya.
