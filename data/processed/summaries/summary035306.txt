Tiger Woods calls jibe aimed at him by fellow golfer Sergio Garcia 'wrong' and 'hurtful'.
Garcia had said he would serve fried chicken to Woods if he was to host him for dinner.
Spaniard denies his comment was meant as racial jibe towards Woods.
The pair have been arguing publicly since acrimonious round earlier in May.
