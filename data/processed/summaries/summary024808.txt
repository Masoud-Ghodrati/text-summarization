Derek Shrout, 17, is free after posting $75,000 bond set by an Alabama judge.
He was arrested Saturday after a teacher found a journal that contained alleged terror plots.
6 students, 1 teacher were named as targets in his violent plot, a sheriff says.
Shrout's lawyer says it was "just a lot of talk," claiming his client wouldn't hurt anyone.
