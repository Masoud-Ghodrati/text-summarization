Darnell "Dynasty" Young can return to high school next January, the school district says.
Young, 17, pulled a stun gun on students he said bullied him at his Indianapolis high school.
"I brought the stun gun 'cause I wasn't safe," the teen says.
"The district does not condone bullying," a spokeswoman says.
