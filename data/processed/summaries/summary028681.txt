Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré asks why New York has ignored all the lessons learned from Katrina.
Honoré: Sandy recovery has no command center, nobody in charge and no troop presence.
After Katrina, National Guard was out in force and hospital ship was available, he says.
FEMA workers complain they have difficulty reaching Sandy storm victims, he says.
