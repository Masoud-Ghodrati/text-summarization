Robots known as "Roombots" are paving the way for furniture that can build itself.
Roombots will combine active and passive parts to create all kinds of furnishings.
Each roombot is a small cube and contains batteries, motors and a wireless connection.
Mobile furniture could benefit the elderly and people with poor mobility.
