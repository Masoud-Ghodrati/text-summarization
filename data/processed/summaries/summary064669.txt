Israeli government says settlers will be gone by Sunday from an area in Beit El.
Israel's Supreme Court ruled last year their homes were built on privately owned Palestinian land.
Settlers' anger eased when Israel announced plans for new housing in another part of Beit El.
The Palestinian who owns the land says he's thrilled at the Israeli court's decision.
