W. Virginia officials didn't update a background check database in time, prosecutor says.
The "inexcusable delay" allowed suspect to buy a gun, prosecutor says.
Once updated, database stopped a second gun purchase by Tennis Melvin Maynard.
Maynard is accused of killing West Virginia Sheriff Walter E. "Eugene" Crum.
