Suspect Paul Ciancia, 23, is in critical condition and could face the death penalty.
Wife of slain TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez, 39, says her husband "took pride in his duty".
Police, responding to family concern, arrived at Ciancia's apartment shortly after he left for airport.
The TSA chief says security protocol is under review.
