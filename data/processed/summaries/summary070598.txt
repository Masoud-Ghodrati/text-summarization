Four French journalists held in Syria since June are free, French President's office says.
The four men are in good health despite the tough conditions they endured in captivity, it says.
The journalists are now in Turkey and are expected back in France in the coming hours.
Two of them worked for Europe 1; its CEO spoke of his "immense joy" at the release of all four.
