Humam Khalil Abu-Mulal al-Balawi has been ID'd as bomber who killed 7 CIA agents.
Newly released video shows al-Balawi describing what led to suicide attack.
He says CIA team was not original target, but "a gift from God," who sent "valuable prey".
Al-Balawi says in video he fooled Jordanian officials into thinking he worked for them.
