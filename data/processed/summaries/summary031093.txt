3 Americans died in a brazen attack on a gas facility earlier this year.
Federal prosecutors charge an Algerian Islamist fighter with crimes related to the attack.
The man, Mokhtar Belmokhtar, is founder of the group that claimed responsibility for the attack.
Belmokhtar is being sought internationally.
