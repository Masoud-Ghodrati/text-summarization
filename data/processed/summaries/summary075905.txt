Footballer turned TV presenter Kevin Kilbane reported West Ham fans' disablist chants to the FA.
The chant allegedly focused on Tottenham Hotspur's Harry Kane and mocked people with disabilities.
Kilbane, who has a daughter with Down's syndrome, said his children would be devastated if they heard it.
