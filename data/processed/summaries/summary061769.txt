Man accused of running "revenge porn" site tells KFMB he's done with the business.
But Kevin Bollaert, 27, says he hasn't done anything illegal.
Authorities say Bollaert created a site for people to post sexually explicit photos of others.
They allege he then used another site to solicit payments to get the materials removed.
