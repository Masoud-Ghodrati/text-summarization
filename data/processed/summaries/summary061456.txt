Henry Stuart specializes in producing 360-degree pictures for Getty Images in Sochi.
He captures the skier with multiple frames at different points all the way down the hill.
Stuart says he wants to get "the sense of the steepness and the speed of the skier".
He takes around 40 pictures per jump and will use about 20 in the final composite image.
