Roy Peter Clark notes that "Wolf of Wall Street" uses f-word hundreds of times.
He says the word has become more acceptable, though still not fit for polite society.
The f-word is one of the most versatile words in the English language, he says.
Clark: There's a numbing quality to overuse of the f-word.
