The 70-day torch relay started in Land's End, Cornwall, and will finish in London.
The flame will pass within 10 miles of 95% of the U.K. population along the route.
Ben Ainslie, who has won three Olympic golds in sailing, was the first torchbearer.
The flame was lit on May 10 at ancient Olympia, in Greece, birthplace of the Games.
