Christiane Amanpour traveled to India to meet with the exiled Dalai Lama.
In 1959, the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback to evade China's communist forces.
Amanpour says the Dalai Lama's connection to his adoring flock is "mesmerizing".
Dalai Lama says what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to "cultural genocide".
