NEW: Prosecutor: The alleged attempt to bring cash into Italy was "extremely sophisticated".
A Vatican official and two other people have been arrested, the prosecutor says.
The 3 arrests are not directly linked to a probe into the Vatican bank, he says.
Pope Francis set up a papal commission this week to look at the bank's activities.
