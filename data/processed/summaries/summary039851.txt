NEW: Rep. Giffords will travel with a nurse, a source close to her says.
The congresswoman continues to recover from a brain injury after a gunshot to the head.
Her husband is Capt. Mark Kelly, commander of Friday's scheduled space shuttle mission.
Giffords won't be making any public remarks while attending the launch.
