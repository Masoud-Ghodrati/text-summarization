The IDs of the 30 U.S. service members killed will be released soon.
The aircraft used in Monday's strike was the F-16, but it's not clear how many were involved.
The airstrike killed a Taliban leader and the insurgent who fired on the copter, ISAF says.
ISAF troops followed them into woods, called for strike; Taliban associates were also killed.
