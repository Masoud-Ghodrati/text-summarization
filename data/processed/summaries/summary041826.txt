For first time in history, Army recognizes soldiers held as slaves in Nazi Germany.
Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles presented six Berga survivors with flags flown over Pentagon.
350 soldiers held at Berg an der Elster; "It was a slave labor camp," general says.
"These men were abused and put under some of the most horrific conditions".
