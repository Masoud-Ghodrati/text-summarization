Writers: Pfc. Bradley Manning is one of the biggest whistleblowers in U.S. history.
They say the public needs to know about the U.S. war crimes and torture he revealed.
Manning should have been sentenced to the 3Â½ years he already served, they say.
Writers: 35-year sentence reflects government's despotic desire to "send a message".
