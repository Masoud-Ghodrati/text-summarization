Key structural changes seen in brain scans of some patients with memory loss.
One year later, many patients with brain changes had developed Alzheimer's.
Memory-loss patients without these changes were mostly stable one year later.

The bottom line: The average person can't run out and get an MRI that shows if they're on the road to Alzheimer's just yet. But these findings could help drugmakers as well as patients in the future..
