Twenty years ago, I moved to the U.S. from the Soviet Union with my family, says Igor Krotov.
I have worked for CNN since 1992, and my son is now a young man, he says.
Last year I was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and I had to undergo surgery, Krotov says.
Krotov: My illness taught me to appreciate life; I feel grateful every day for what I have.
