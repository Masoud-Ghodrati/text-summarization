Bob Greene: All eyes on England for jubilee, upcoming Olympics, but recall another anniversary.
June 1942, Dwight Eisenhower took command in Europe; it would soon be the end for Hitler.
Greene says Ike made personal sacrifices for service, went on to help Allies to victory.
Greene: As "God Save the Queen" rings out this month, take moment to bless Eisenhower, too.
