The LEGO Foundation -- the charitable arm of the LEGO Group -- has opened a school in Denmark.
The school aims to deliver the traditional curriculum required by the Danish government with play-centric teaching.
The LEGO Foundation is looking to collaborate with the school to learn more about child development.
