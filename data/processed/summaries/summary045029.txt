No More, an anti-domestic violence campaign, teams up with the NFL's ad group for the Super Bowl commercial.
The ad is inspired by a domestic violence call that a dispatcher received and posted to Reddit.
With her abuser nearby, the caller pretends to order pizza to tell the dispatcher to send help.
