The Internet of Things is the idea that all physical objects could communicate data over the internet to other connected devices.
In rural Wales, researchers have begun a study into the Internet of Sheep, attaching devices to livestock to gather information.
Researchers say the beauty of sheep is that they stick together -- easily transmitting data between the flock.
When the flock comes close to an internet receiving station it would transmit data to researchers at Lancaster University.
