Tushar Malik: India's high court just made being gay illegal, upholding old colonial law.
Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling four years ago to legalize homosexuality.
Malik remembers being hopeful when being gay was made legal; many came out of closet.
He says, "while India's Supreme Court justices took my freedom, they cannot take my hope".
