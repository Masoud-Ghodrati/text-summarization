First animated Christmas special, "Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol," is 50.
"Magoo" paved the way for "Charlie Brown," "Grinch," "Frosty," "Rudolph".
Though it has fallen into relative obscurity, the fan base remains solid.
"Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol" will air tonight for the first time since 1967.
