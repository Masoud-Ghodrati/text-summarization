NEW: "No drugs were found on DMX or the other passengers," his publicist says.
The officer recognized DMX and knew there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest.
The arrest comes 4 weeks after DMX was charged with drunk driving in Greenville, S.C..
DMX was released after being cited for simple possession of marijuana.
