Victorious ski star Lindsey Vonn says: "I'm back to where I used to be.".
The American clocks a dominant win at the World Cup downhill in Val d'Isere.
Vonn injured her knee in the same event 12 months ago which end her Olympic defense.
A 61st World Cup win for Vonn means she is now one win away from equaling all-time record.
