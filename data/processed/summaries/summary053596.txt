U.S. intelligence agencies are urging staffers to use a new social-networking site.
Called A-Space, it's for analysts within the nation's 16 intelligence agencies.
Analysts can use A-Space to share information about al Qaeda, other issues.
Only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance can access the site.
