Michele Weldon says on Mother's Day, single motherhood should be celebrated.
She says popular culture consigns kids of single moms to failure, but there's more to story.
She says kids of single moms have challenges, but studies show many do very well.
Weldon says she's a single mom of three flourishing young men, productive and happy.
