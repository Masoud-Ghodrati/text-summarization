Suspended New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez has dropped a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Yankees' team doctor and New York Presbyterian Hospital, according to court paperwork filed Thursday.
Rodriguez had alleged that the Yankees' Dr. Christopher S. Ahmad had misdiagnosed Rodriguez's hip injury, clearing him for play when a second doctor recommended surgery.
