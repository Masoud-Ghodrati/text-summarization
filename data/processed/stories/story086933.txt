I have to mention tonight the headline that caught my eye on the CNN Ticker earlier today: "Porn Industry Seeks Federal Bailout."
Yeah, you heard me.
The porn industry wants a bailout.
Leave it to Hustler publisher Larry Flynt and "Girls Gone Wild" CEO Joe Francis to take the absurdity of what is going on now with our federal bailout program to a whole new level.
According to their press release, the adult entertainment industry needs $5 billion of your tax money because it, too, has been hit by the economic downturn.
They concede the $13 billion industry is in no fear of collapse, but say in this environment, why take chances?
I don't really think this requires commentary or condemnation, just thought you would enjoy it.
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.
