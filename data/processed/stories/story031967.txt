The body of a man whom authorities described as a disgruntled vendor who shot two people, one fatally, at a Long Island business last week was found dead Monday, according to Nassau County Police.
Sang Ho Kim, about age 63, was identified through fingerprints after his remains were found in a river near Bear Mountain in Rockland County, New York, according to Detective Michael Bitsko.
A passerby found the remains Monday and contacted authorities.
An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death.
The shooting occurred on Wednesday at Savenergy in East Garden City on Long Island, prompting a widespread manhunt that ended with the discovery of Kim's body. One employee was killed and another was injured.
