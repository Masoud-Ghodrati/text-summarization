The debate comes just days before the end of the United Nations summit on climate change where negotiators have been hard at work on a draft treaty to set limits on carbon emissions and to secure funding to help poor nations to cope with the challenges of a warming world.
It follows a special week of "Going Green" coverage on CNN to highlight the impact of climate change around the world.
