The Louisiana National Guard's highest ranking enlisted soldier has been removed from active duty after "substantiated allegations" of sexual harassment and possible sexual assault, a spokesman said Monday.
Sgt. Maj. Tommy Caillier was removed on June 14 "for cause" in relation to allegations by a member of the National Guard, spokesman Lt. Col Mike Kazmierzak said.
A criminal investigation has been launched into possible sexual assault, he said.
Caillier has requested defense council from the National Guard, Kazmierzak said.
The case comes as the U.S. military is under pressure to crack down on sexual assault that victims say is rampant in the culture of the armed forces.
