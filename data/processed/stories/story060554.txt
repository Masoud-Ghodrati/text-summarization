In this week's episode of Justin Bieber's brush with the law, the pop singer has been accused of attempted robbery, police said.
It sounds worse than it may be: The alleged incident is apparently over a cell phone.
Los Angeles Police Department robbery detectives were investigating a report of an alleged robbery Monday night "between an individual and Mr. Bieber near the batting cages" on Los Angeles' west side, a police statement said Wednesday.
"The case remains under investigation with detectives conducting numerous interviews," police said.
A source close who's close to Bieber and is familiar with the situation played down the incident.
