A train derailed outside of Naples, Italy, Friday, killing one person and leaving about 40 injured, a railroad service spokesman said.
A 71-year-old man died, and one passenger is in critical condition, said Giustiniano Carmine, a spokesman for the Circumvesuviana rail service. Most of the other injuries were minor, he said.
Investigators plan to review video images from inside the train as they try to learn what caused the wreck, he said.
