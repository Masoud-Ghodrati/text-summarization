Search teams found the body of a 25-year-old snowboarder Sunday under more than 8 feet of ice on Oregon's Mt. Hood.
Collin Backowski was killed after a tunnel he was snowboarding through collapsed, burying him under snow and ice, said Hood River Sheriff's spokeswoman Tiffany Peterson.
Twelve people used chainsaws and other hand tools to dig his body out from under 8 to 10 feet of snow and ice. In total, they moved several tons of debris by hand, the sheriff's office said.
Backowski, of Pines, Colorado, was part of a group with six other snowboarders.
He had gotten farther ahead of the group when the ice tunnel collapsed.
Two others were hit with debris but not hurt.
The group tried to dig Backowski out, but could not break through the ice and snow.
